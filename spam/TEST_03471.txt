It's hard for distributions to include the latest KDE SC available *and* 
deliver it as "stable". Rolling distros (such Arch Linux), which are

+1 for openSUSE :-)

But remember that openSUSE 11.2 is still including kde 4.3.5 under their 
stable KDE repo. KDESC 4.4 is available under factory/testing repo.
