Hi,

I would like to be able to launch some command in the console, and to be
able to close the terminal, the command being still evaluated, i.e. if I
launch gedit (I'm under GNOME), and that I close the console, gedit
closes too. (This is also the case with `gedit &', which is not
astonishing.)

Is it even possible?

Thanks folks.
