Re: Re: Xcode 3.2 fails to highlight errors in Java sourceThe current version of Xcode (version 3.2.2) addresses this issue of displa=
ying Java errors in the source code. The workaround that I had posted is no=
 longer necessary.

Hi Michael and Greg,

Following Greg's good advice, I have generated an awk script that eliminate=
s the need to have a separate file such as the sed script. The entire scrip=
t is self contained in the xant script. I have pasted the lines below which=
 includes documentation on the script.

Also, this script is more accurate than the sed script since it tests that =
the line number is preceded by a java source path.

This is just a workaround for a bug. I really hope Apple fixes this bug!

Thanks to Michael for raising this issue and to Greg for his good advice an=
d patch to my previous script.

thanks,
tom
