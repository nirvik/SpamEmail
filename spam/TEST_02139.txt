As I said in one of my previous posts, udev will not create
/dev/sdaX, nor their counterpart using names or uuid. So I
can't do that.

My previous post was premature, if I restore /dev/sdaX using tar,
I can only use the console. X can't make use of the keyboard or mouse.
/edv/eth0 also doesn't exist, althought the interface is up, etc.
It looks like all /dev/ is screwed up!

So I will install from scratch.
