Re: AUGD: Displaying iPad at a meeting, what doesn't work
Unfortunately, the video output of the iphone and the ipad does not mirror
the main screen.

It's essentially a secondary display output, which only shows content from
apps that are specifically coded to recognize that secondary display.

The itunes/ipod player and quicktime player do this and when you play a
video clip, it shows up through the vga output.  But other than that, you
will see nothing via the external connector.

Our group has decided to start an iphone/ipad SIG, so we will also be
looking for a permanent solution that will allow us to put the screens of
these devices up on a projector.

So I look forward to hearing further reports regarding the ichat method.
