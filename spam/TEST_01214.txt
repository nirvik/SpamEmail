acroread not seeing printersHello, all.  We've installed acroread 8.1.7-0.1 from debian-multimedia.
It is not seeing any of the printers on our cups print server.  It just
shows the custom lpr printer.  How do we get it to see our printers like
all the other applications in our KDE setup do? We are running Lenny +
backports.  Thanks - John
