I have not had the problem (I use the radeon driver), and do not know of 
a solution, but wanted to point you to a recent changelog that might be 
of interest.

(from 
<http://packages.debian.org/changelogs/pool/main/x/xorg/current/changelog>)

----------------
  Debian Changelog xorg (1:7.5+6)

xorg (1:7.5+6) unstable; urgency=medium

    * Drop radeonhd from xserver-xorg-video-all.  We switched to kernel
      modesetting for radeon, and that clashes with this driver.
