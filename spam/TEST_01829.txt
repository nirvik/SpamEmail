This may not be acceptable for testing users, but the rules are pretty
clear: all release architectures must be in sync in testing.  This often
holds up important fixes for months.

The conclusion I had drawn from this long ago: don't use testing, it is
only meant to be a staging area for preparing the next release and not
as a distribution actually to be used by people, except during freezes
maybe.

Use stable or unstable instead, or a mixed testing/unstable system where
you upgrade packages that are broken in testing from unstable.
