This is what I was mentioning before.  Support you have two cable/dsl modems
connected to a debian machine.  Use load balancing using "netxhop" option of
iproute2 as shown by the following link..
http://lartc.org/howto/lartc.rpdb.multiple-links.html
But note that suppose you have two connetion of 1mbps each, You will not be
able to do one single 2mbps download per session.  But you could have 2
sessions of 1mbps each.
Otherwise you could use custom download accelerators, torrent etc. which
could split a logical download to multiple sessions.
