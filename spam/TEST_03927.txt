I have more bandwidth (1Mbps) at nitgh than during the day (256kbps).
I would like to launch a dist-upgrade, but I want it to happen face to
me. I'd rather pre-download the .debs and launch real dist-upgrade face
to face.

Thank you all for your indications. I already have all the needed
packages downloaded, I'll dist-upgrade tomorow.
