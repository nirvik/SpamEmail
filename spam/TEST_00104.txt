"update-alternatives" output shows that the wrong java plugin version is 
being picked (openJDK instead Sun's Java one).

Mmmm, try first to setup with "update-alternatives", but in this form 
(one line):

***
update-alternatives --config firefox-javaplugin.so
***

Look if the above command let you choose between the two options and 
choose the Sun's one. 

If that does not work, you can try with the steps provided in Oracle/Sun 
site (manual way).
