Origins of Software EngineeringThe academic discipline of Software Engineering was launched at a conference
sponsored by NATO, at Garmisch, Germany, in October, 1968. Intriguingly, the
term Software Engineering was chosen to be deliberately provocative -- why
can't software be developed with the same rigor used by other engineering
disciplines?

The proceedings of this conference are now available online, at:

Also, don't miss the pictures of attendees, including many significant
contributors to the field of Software Engineering:
