It did for me, but I am not willing to say it is not a tcl/tk issue as
other apps seemed to work OK for cut and paste and Tk does its
clipboard stuff a bit differently than most toolkits. So I'm not
about to place blame. Just reporting my experience.

Also, I am not talking about installing Gnome2. Just updating the
many, many pieces of gnome to the current rev level.
