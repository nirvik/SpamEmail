What are my locale settings, for non-terminal apps?I need to have separate locale settings for my terminal apps, so I
configure that in .bash_profile. I assume that my desktop environment
is using my locale settings from .profile but I'd like to confirm what
those settings are. How can I get the output of locale _not_ from a
terminal (which will source .bash_profile and thus be incorrect)?

Thanks.
