sync taking forever to finishHi

Interesting problems, symptom, when I insert a usb key into machine,
the partition as not being created in /dev/.  What I have found is
that /etc/init.d/hdparm hotplug is being called, it does a sync. And
the sync is getting stuck.

So if I ssh to my box to a sync it gets stuck, if I open another ssh
to the same box and turn off collectd, the sync finishes.  With
collectd off, sync finish quickly.

I have waited around 10 min for the sync to finish whilst collectd is
doing its stuff.

This a problem with collectd ?
