ditching muttAfter over 10 years of faithful service (essentially when I ditched pine),
I am considering having my mutt put down. Should I move over to gmail, or is
there some amazing scriptable GUI mail client that is going to knock my
socks off with an array of pipes and regexps and color-highlighting and
maybe even procmail-parsing and custom keybinding? (Ideally I'd still like
to use a terminal to compose/reply to most email, it's just the inbox/IMAP
folder management/searching/etc that is getting too unruly for a terminal).

  Thanks,
    Tyler
