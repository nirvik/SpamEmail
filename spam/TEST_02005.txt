I'm uising Havoc Pennington's Gnomehide and it rocks. I installed it before I
knew about apt, but one of the previous emails had an apt repository that
claimed to have gnomehide. Just remember there is one kew file that makes the
difference between Gnome1 and Gnome2 being used. I *think* it is "gnome-core"
vs. "gnome-session" but I can not remember.

Note that that those same files are probably in the Limbo beta, except
updated. There has not been a major change to "gnomehide" in a while, I
suspect Havoc's work went into Limbo then.
