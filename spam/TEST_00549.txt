OK, so, you get the XML toss it through hardware and turn it back into a
struct/object whatever you call your binary data. I agree this is the way
things will go, as XML parsing has just too much overhead to survive in the
application layer. So why turn it into XML in the first place? Becasue it
gives geeks something to do and sells XML hardware accelerators and way more
CPUs?

Is there anyone out there actually doing anything new that actually IMPROVES
things anymore, or are they all too scared of the fact that improvements put
people out of work and cut #1 is the creators...
