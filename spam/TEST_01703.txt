It's probably illegal to set the background color, too.

Declan:

As you know, a district court judge recently entered a preliminary 
injunction against Gator in a lawsuit brought by numerous website news 
publishers over Gator's pop-up advertising service.  In my most recent 
column for The Wall Street Journal Online (now available on GigaLaw.com
at http://www.gigalaw.com/articles/2002/isenberg-2002-08.html), I
examine the potential greater effect of this lawsuit.  For example:
"Terence Ross of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, the news publishers' attorney,
even told me that he thinks Internet users who configure their browsers
to disable graphics (a common tactic to boost the speed of Web surfing)
are committing copyright infringement because they are interfering with
Web publishers' exclusive right to control how their pages are
displayed."
