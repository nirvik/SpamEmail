I've never heard of any CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive having problems with DMA...
although there probably is since Red Hat decided to default disabling it a
few releases back :-/
Normally, even if you try to enable DMA and your device doesn't support it,
it simply don't be able to make the change, and that's it. The problem IIRC
is with crappy hardware that is supposed to support DMA but doesn't work as
expected when it's enabled... maybe Chris could confirm this? ;-)

I guess I'll settle for the /dev/dvd link change as described and putting
the DMA tip in the %description :-)
