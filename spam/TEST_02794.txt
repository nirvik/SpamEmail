After a ppp connection is established, pppd(8) runs the scripts in 
/etc/ppp/ip-up.d . Check the man page for pppd(8) under the section
SCRIPTS. This describes which scripts are run when and what environment
variables are available.

The standard ppp runs the script /etc/ppp/ip-up when the link comes up.
Debian implements this script to run all the scripts in /etc/ppp/ip-up.d
