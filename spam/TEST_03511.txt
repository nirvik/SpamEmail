Is there a way to manage a WS 3500 Lacrosse Technology wheather station
 under Debian Lenny ?I've read somewhere that a Lacrosse WS2300 or 23?? was being 
successfully mastered, but I can't find the appropriate links. What 
about my WS 3500 ?  the MSWIN driver that I got with it, is called 
"Heavy Wheather 3600", as it is supposed to manage both WS3500 and WS3600.

There is a SERIAL connexion between the wheather station and the PC.

Thanks in advance for any advice.
