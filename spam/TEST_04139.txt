How to remove oowriter delay on opening document?Good day.


I have oowriter from testing repo installed w/ all the necessary dependencies. Now at opening of the first document it hangs for about 40 seconds - all other documents it opens quickly - the same is for oocalc.

Is there anything I can do to remove this delays?


Thanks for Your time.

PS Please, reply to the list.
