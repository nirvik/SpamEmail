Virtualbox meets more of your individual criteria than anything else I 
can think of, but the open source edition lacks USB.  I would consider 
the non-OSE version for now, but only if I were prepared to migrate to 
something else, later, depending on what Oracle may choose to to with 
it, now that they own Sun.

Some version of QEMU with KVM will always work, but you definitely need 
the KVM bits, because by itself QEMU is not a speed demon.

I enjoy Xen-like hypervisors from an aesthetics point-of-view, but the 
best ones are not free in any sense.  Microsoft's Hyper-V flat-out costs 
money, and VMware's ESXi comes with too much baggage.  Xen itself is 
still in a state of flux, and though the 2.6.32 kernel version is much 
more stable than previous versions, I wouldn't call it ready for prime 
time.


Good Luck
