[Razor-users] Change timeout setting???This is a semi-followup on my previous question. I am running razor-check
through a sendmail milter (smrazor http://www.sapros.com/smrazor/ ) and have
set up my milter timeouts to 20sec connect and 30 sec response. The problem
is that there is another timeout setting for razor-check that I am unable to
locate. My razor-agent.log is now getting filled with :

check[6149]: [ 3] Timed out (15 sec) while reading from honor.cloudmark.com.

So the question is, is there a razor-agent.conf file setting to increase
this timeout value? I have this problem on 2 different servers now (as
apparently ubik.cloudmark and apt.cloudmark are refusing connections) ......
