This is what cvs puts in when you modify the copy of the file on your disk
and someone checks in a change and then you pull an update and cvs can't
figure out how to merge your changes and the checked in changes. The lines
between the <<<<<< and the ===== are in your file and the ones in the next
section are what have been checked in. You must have not noticed the warning
messages about conflicts that cvs gave you when you did the update, and the
"C" flag next to that file when cvs listed the files being pulled.
