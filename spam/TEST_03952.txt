One of the things you need to understand with gnome2 is that while they
did simplify a lot of things, most of the configuration options people
found very useful are still available through gconf. Learn to love
gconf-editor ;) -- metacity can have sloppy focus (Desktop Preferences
-> Window Focus -- there's actually GUI for that), and the delay until
raising (and whether it raises) can be set in gconf-editor,
/apps/metacity/general/auto_raise and auto_raise_delay

Well, it definitely is not the same as 1.4. Some people will always like
gnome 1 better. Whatever suits your needs.

I think you need to understand that simplifying the configuration
options and the UI does make it a lot easier to use for people who are
either not using it all the time or are just starting to use it. The
GNOME team decided that advanced users who want to edit the kinds of
options you talk about are advanced enough to use gconf-editor.
Personally, I'm fine with that, because I don't find gconf-editor hard
to use :)
