Xine dependenciesOn a RH 8 box, I'm trying to install your package
xine-0.9.13-fr5.i386.rpm, I keep running into dependency problems.  I've
tried to install the dev and lib rpm's as well and they error out with
dependency problems on each other (they each want something from the
other's package).

I've tried the --without options, but still end up with (similar for the
regular package),

	glut is needed by xine-libs-0.9.13-fr5
        aalib is needed by xine-libs-0.9.13-fr5
        lirc is needed by xine-libs-0.9.13-fr5
        libaa.so.1 is needed by xine-libs-0.9.13-fr5
        libglut.so.3 is needed by xine-libs-0.9.13-fr5

What am I missing here?

Thanks for your efforts.
