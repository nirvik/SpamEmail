Yes, and the working class deserves what it gets, and possibly not even
that.  For the most part, people become wealthy by not being stupid.  I
always thought "not being stupid (most of the time)" was a fairly low
bar, but apparently most people can't even manage that.

That is really what it all boils down to:  There are lots of ignorant
and/or stupid people who are quite happy to stay that way, and it is a
key causal factor in why things are the way they are.  What are you
going to do about it?
