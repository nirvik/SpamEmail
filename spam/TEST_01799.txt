 Null, the third beta was out last week.

 It'll be an interesting release. Gnome 2.0, and GCC 3.2 - both very new,
large projects.

 I'd not be putting it on any production machines for a while...

 Though many say "RedHat X.0 releases are rubbish" - it's worth baring in
mind that they jump a release when the underlying archtechture changes, not
just the installer, so they are .0 for a reason.
