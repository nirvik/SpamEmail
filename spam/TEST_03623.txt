Re: USA USA WE ARE NUMBER ....six.Cheers, Adam.

Perhaps people are starting to notice how profit motive drains the 
meaning out of their lives. Kinda sucks to be an ant farming for the 
corporate lords. Funny how most of the rest of the world is more and 
more apprehensive towards American Democracy.

I just went to DC for the first time. I was awestruck by the 
monuments, the words of Thomas Jefferson, the Spirit of Democracy set 
in stone. Amazing to think that in little more than 200 years our 
government could be so far removed from those honorable principles. 
Adam Smith presumed that the marketplace would regulate itself 
through morality, good faith, and responsibility. Corporate America 
seems to feel that those principles stand in the way of making the 
real bucks. How much more can they co-opt and commodify? Get your 
copyrights in quick so you can hold on to your piece of the pie. 
Health care, public programs, pensions, social security - these are 
now regarded as worthless unless they can turn a profit.

Ah, socialized medicine. Siestas. 6 week vacation leave. I hear Spain 
is nice this time of year...
