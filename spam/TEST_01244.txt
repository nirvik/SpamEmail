May I suggest:
---
If "sid" is used in the above example instead of "lenny", the "deb:
http://security.debian.org/ =E2=80=A6" line for security updates in the
"/etc/apt/sources.list" is not required as there is no need to have a=20
separate security update archive for "sid". This is because "sid"
(unstable) is *usually* updated whenever security issues are fixed for=20
stable.

However, it can happen that the fixes are not applied immediately (e.g. =20
the maintainer is waiting for a new version from upstream which fixes=20
the issue) or issues exist which do not affect the version in stable or=20
testing, in which case Debian will not even issue a DSA.

(DSA might need expanding/explaining if not already done in some other=20
paragraph)
