  | That's something that POSIX would do - make every platform as

  | we try & make everyone better".

 eh?  POSIX doesn't "do" anything.  POSIX is a de jour
 specification for a voluntary minimal implementation to
 encourage software transportability.  no-one, absolutely
 no-one, has or ever had to implement POSIX or be restricted
 to POSIX.  commercial considerations et.al. may encourage
 some "POSIX-compatibility", but that's a freely-made choice.

 IMHO, the process's weakness is a general rule --- which
 has been ignored on occasion --- to only consider "formal"
 submissions of "proven" technologies.  that translates into
 specifying more-or-less common parts of the existing *ix
 implementations which actively contribute to the process.
 most of the committees are loath to blue-sky, solicit
 proposals/research, or pick an uncommon or unsponsored
 implementation, even when manifestly superior.  (IMHO,
 this is why POSIX is *ix and not, e.g., Plan9 or Inferno.)

 OTOH, considering the motivating force behind the process,
 it can be argued the above "weakness" is a strength ....

 yep.  which is not to say POSIX "sucks" per se.  but the old
 pre-POSIX *ix world arguably did, at least in terms of ease
 of software porting.  one of *ix's claims to fame is it is
 perhaps the first system where one could seriously consider
 porting, more or less intact and with relative ease, software
 from one architecture+platform+vendor to a radically utterly
 different triple.

 however, as people discovered, there's a lot of difference
 between "consider porting" and "actually porting" --- and
 some problems were silly.  some were self-inflicted (e.g.,
 assuming byte-orientation or a particular endianness); but
 others were Frustrating "system" incompatibilities --- the
 motivating force that lead to /usr/group, XPG (X/Open), POSIX,
 Spec1170, Unix98, Common Unix, &tc.
