eats less CPU that the CAOpenGLLayer approach.  (If I were playing half =
a dozen movies at once, maybe it would be different.)  Also, the =
CAOpenGLLayer approach prohibits compiling for 64 bits (since various =

QTMovieOpenForPlaybackAttribute.


Comparaison is meaningless. QTKit uses separate processes to decode the =
movies.
