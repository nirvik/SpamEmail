router policy questionOn my nets, I need to be able to telnet/ssh into the border router, from =
the inside, to futz with it.=20

But is there any reason at all to allow anything, aside from some ICMP, =
to go beyond the ACL on its Internet facing interface -- to get to the =
router itself, that is?=20
