Interestingly, the section you refer to includes the following =
statement:

less than or equal to sizeof(void*), a float, a double, a long double, =
or a long long, then a message sent to nil returns 0."

This makes me wonder what the answer is for an integer scalar of size =
*greater* than sizeof(void*) that isn't a long long.

For example, if the architecture has sizeof(long) > sizeof(void*), the =
above definition would rule out long, but rule in long long. Odd.
