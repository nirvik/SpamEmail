Preferences is explained here:
<http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/qa/qa2001/qa1170.html>

Logs should probably go into System.getProperty("user.home") + =
"/Library/Logs/" + "your.app.identifier".

Caches should either go in the directory returned from =
System.getProperty("java.io.tmpdir"), or System.getProperty("user.home") =
+ "/Library/Caches/" + "your.app.identifier".

Database files, autosave information, and other things that represent =
user data that could be lost if deleted should go into =
System.getProperty("user.home") + "/Library/Application Support/" + =
"Your App Name".

To request a new tech note, or update the existing QA1170 with this =
information, please file a request at <http://bugreporter.apple.com>.
