Too, too, too, true.  Just you try to muck with Job's blessed Aqua 
interface.   Or remove the fscking dock.  OSX is such a step down from 
Classic with Kaleidoscope skinning the entire UI.  As an artist, I resent 
it deeply.   (This is not in praise of Classic.)  If my environment cannot 
be made beautiful, in some sense I cannot live.
