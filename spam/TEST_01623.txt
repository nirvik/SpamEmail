I disagree. Mirroring only protects you against drive failures and not
human error.  Using a second drive as a target for a tool which stores
incremental backups (such as rdiff-backup, or bup (package forthcoming))
can save you from human mistakes too.  For common home setups, I would
recommend that over mirroring.
