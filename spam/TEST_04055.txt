[Razor-users] False Positives on EFF MessagesHi everyone,

I'm the systems admin for the Electronic Frontier Foundation and I'm using razor 
running under spam assassin there and one my own personal server. Generally it 
works fine with near 0 false positives - except - that almost all the false 
positives I've seen are on messages that originated at EFF.

So - I am wondering why RAZOR is catching EFF email and how is this happening. 
Below is an example of what I'm talking about.

Document: HP backs off DMCA threat

By CNET News.com Staff
August 1, 2002, 6:10 PM PT

Hewlett-Packard Thursday abandoned legal threats it made against security 
analysts who publicized flaws in the company's software.

In a statement released late Thursday, HP said it would not use the Digital 
Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), a controversial copyright law, to pursue a 
loosely-organized team of researchers who demonstrated a bug in the company's 
Tru64 Unix operating system.

The following is the company's statement:

1) HP is committed to protecting our customer's security environments.

2) We have verified that there is a security vulnerability with Tru64 UNIX, the 
details of which were brought to our attention July 18. The problem has now been 
isolated and HP has been preparing a fix, which will be available within the 
next 48 hours.

3) We won't comment on the specifics of our discussions with SnoSoft. However, 
we take our customers' security requirements very seriously and have a strong 
track record following industry-standard security practices.

4) Where and how the DMCA should be applied is a matter of great controversy. 
The reported letter to SnoSoft was not consistent or indicative of HP's policy. 
We can say emphatically that HP will not use the DMCA to stifle research or 
impede the flow of information that would benefit our customers and improve 
their system security.
