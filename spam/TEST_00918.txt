I do not remember having had such a problem with pymol in debian. As I 
understand it, the command "from copy import deepcopy" is the first to 
run at all.

Given that the module copy is in the python standard library, I find it 
surprising that it is not found. Do you have any problems with other 
python programs?

Can you run the line
python -c "from copy import deepcopy"
without problems (errors)?
