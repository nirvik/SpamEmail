cannot type power of 1 or 2, 4-9 are typeable.im trying to type [copy from character map] power of 2. i can read
power of 2 on webpages but if i were to cope > paste from that page,
the power displays as a normal character 2. is this a
dpkg-reconfigure locales issue?

how can i gain the ability to type a power of 2?
