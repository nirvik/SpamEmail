	http://www.stearns.org/razor-caching-proxy/ is what you're looking 
for for the razor1 protocol.  The equivalent for razor2 is on hold pending 
documentation of the razor2 protocol.
	Jordan, is that still in the "finishing touches" stage?  *smile*  
I'm betting that the infinite demands of getting a startup going put it on

check it over, I'd be glad to do that.
	Cheers,
