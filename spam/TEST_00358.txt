Re: creating tables...html1. you have overlapping tags: <body> begins before <head> ends;
2. <style> should be in <head>;
3. why the hell are you using the <pre> tag anyway?! For this a few
<br /> would suffice
4. learn xhtml and css2 at least.
5. How is this Debian-related?
6. Camale=C3=B3n's suggestion works.
7. use a validator

As a hint, clear all formatting right at the beginning of your css
file and add as you go. Assuming you're worried about cross-browser
compatibility.
