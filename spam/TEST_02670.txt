Not sure about MG, though I know pretty much everything he penned got into
print at one time or another.  SA needs to do what National Geo did and
put out thier back issues on CD.

Post MG in the 80's there were the colums by A K Dewdney that I dug a
bunch put into a book  called Turing Omnibus and then there is , of
course, all the goodens put out by Dougy Hoffstadler.
