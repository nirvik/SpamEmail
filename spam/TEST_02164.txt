Thanks for all your answers. It actually finally works. I had to
re-source the file twice to make it work. Weird! I was expecting more
than that of emacs, because it normally comes into a mode which depends
on the extension and/or the name of the edited file (e.g. if you edit a
Makefile, it knows that it's a Makefile).

Thanks again.
