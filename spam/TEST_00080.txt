Re: Wifi query802.11b - 11Mbps per channel over three channels in the 2.4GHz range 
(also shared with microwaves and cordless phones) at rages up to ~300 ft.
802.11a runs on 12 channels in the 5GHz range and up to around five 
times more bandwidth (~54Mbps or so) but has less range (60-100 ft). 
8021.11a also adds Forward Error Correction into the scheme to allow for 
more reliable data transmission.
Which to use really depends on what you're doing with it. Streaming 
video almost necessitates 802.11a, while streaming just audio can be 
comfortably done with 802.11b provided that there isn't much 
interference or too many clients.
Prices? Don't know... Haven't done the research. For covering a large 
area 802.11a will be more expensive due to the need for more APs. If you 
want to reach the local coffee shop, however, you will need a 
directional antenna either way.

Check out http://www.80211-planet.com, they've got some good articles on 
802.11... Also, some of the best info on 802.11 security I've seen can 
be found at http://www.drizzle.com/~aboba/IEEE/.
