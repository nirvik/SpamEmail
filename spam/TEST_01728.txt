now available. If you ever wanted to learn to write modules and release
them on CPAN, now is the time. For experienced module makers, the book
offers advanced training in XS, Inline::C and CGI::Application. You can
[2]read the first chapter online for free. The book is shipping now from
[3]Amazon, [4]BN and others."

[0]Ask writes "Leonard Lin put up [1]Lawrence Lessig's Freeing Culture
keynote from OSCON. It's excellent. It's great. It's the slides with
audio in flash. So download that flash player already and click the url.
I also [2]mirrored it at perl.org. You still here? See it already, you
*will* be entertained. Near the end of the keynote Lessig asked how many
had donated to the EFF. Many hands went up. We felt great. 'Yeah, we're
helping!' Then he asked how many had donated more than they spend on
their broadband connection... I don't think I was alone in feeling a bit
busted. :-)"
