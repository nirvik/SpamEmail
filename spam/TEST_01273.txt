That will prove rather quickly if the trouble is local or system wide.

My regret by moving ~/.local out of the way is that all the Wine menu
items disappeared.  It would be nice if the menu editor allowed the 
importing of the individual .desktop files.  I see that moving them back
into ~/.local/share/Applications caused them all to pop into the Lost
and Found section which is better than nothing.
