People just can't stop thinking <wink>.  The classifier should work best
when trained on a wholly random spattering of real life.  If real life
contains duplicates, then that's what the classifier should see.

Sure!  I think it's relevant, but maybe for another purpose.  Paul Svensson
is thinking harder about real people <wink> than the rest of us, and he may
be able to get use out of approaches that identify closely related spam.
For example, some amount of spam is going to end up in the ham training data
in real life use, and any sort of similarity score to a piece of known spam
may be an aid in finding and purging it.
