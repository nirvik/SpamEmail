- _Phil Ringnalda_: Putting on the brakes[1]. &#8220;So, the answer to the 
question that started this whole project, "what is the RDF in RSS 1.0 good 
for?" is two things: it's good for someone who has an infinitely large database 
that can be queried infinitely fast by a schema-aware program, or it's good for 
writing a schema-aware aggregator that can try to figure out what it should do 
with new elements that it hasn't seen before. That's actually an interesting 
project with some potential for success, but at this point I'm sick of the 
whole thing, so I'll leave that project for someone else.&#8221; 
- _Aaron Swartz_: TRAMP: Makes RDF look like Python data structures[2]. 
&#8220;RDF/XML got you down? Tired of having to go through contortions to deal 
with data? Want to write Python and be standards-compatible at the same time? 
Need a module to implement the psuedo-code you had on your slides? TRAMP may or 
may not be the answer to these problems!&#8221; Complete with an example of 
parsing FOAF files. 
- _Dan Connolly_: HyperRDF: Using XHTML Authoring Tools with XSLT to produce 
RDF schemas[3]. &#8220;XML syntax is a little tedious, but lots of people are 
evidently willing and able of editing it by hand. RDF adds another layer of 
tedium, but there are still a few folks willing to write it by hand. I make 
heavy use of reification/quoting in my representation of logical formulas in 
RDF. This adds another layer of tedium that I find unmanageable, and I have 
been writing XML/SGML/HTML by hand for 10 years.&#8221; Also includes a cogent 
explanation of the obscure profile attribute in HTML.
