Re: mount information from DA framework.Hey Dale,

You have to use BSD.  eg.

    1. DADiskCopyDescription()
    2. CFDictionaryGetValue() with kDADiskDescriptionVolumePathKey
    3. CFURLGetFileSystemRepresentation()
    4. statfs()
    5. f_flags with MNT_DONTBROWSE

I have a suggestion though.  It seems to me that the mount can be made =
without the assistance of an I/O Kit extension and a Disk Arbitration =
daemon.  You can mount a diskXs3 partition directly with BSD, through =
your application, agent, or whatnot, without any requirement to expose =
diskXs3s1 in I/O Kit.  eg.

    /sbin/mount -t hfs -o nobrowse /dev/diskXs3 =
/var/tmp/com.MyCompany.MyProduct.X

You can use posix_spawn() to invoke such a command.

PS:  Disk Arbitration 1 is deprecated, thus the sample code that uses =
Disk Arbitration 1 is deprecated.  It is not useful in modern code, but =
if you must insist, look at disktool.c in the Disk Arbitration project.
