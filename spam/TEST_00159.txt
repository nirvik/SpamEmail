I tried also with --revision, e.g.,

fakeroot make-kpkg --revision=lore01 --initrd 
--append-to-version=-recompiled kernel-image kernel-headers

but I cannot seem to get rid of that +drm33.1 string:

linux-headers-2.6.32.10+drm33.1-recompiled_2.6.32.10+drm33.1-recompiled-10.00.Custom_i386.deb

they do not seem to be set:

$ grep VERSION .config
CONFIG_LOCALVERSION=""
# CONFIG_LOCALVERSION_AUTO is not set
