Giant horse images 'defaced by hunting activists'

Pro-hunt activists have defaced two of the country's national monuments - 
the two giant white horses - to highlight their cause.



Campaigners for the Real Countryside Alliance say they targeted the two 
images, on hills in Oxfordshire and North Yorkshire, "to keep the pro-hunt 
thing in the papers".



Aerial shots show the 374ft-long Bronze Age image on the Berkshire Downs 
near Uffington in Oxfordshire complete with three white hounds and a rider.

In North Yorkshire, a rider in full hunt regalia has been added to the 300ft 
White Horse cut in to the hills at Kilburn, which dates back to the 1700s.

But no-one reported anything to the police.

A spokesman for North Yorkshire police said no reports had been received but 
he had seen "a red blob" on the horse and had sent officers to investigate.

In Uffington, no-one in the village had heard anything about the reported 
incident. A spokesman for Thames Valley police said he was not aware of any 
complaints.

Activists say the image in Oxfordshire was drawn in paint used for marking 
lines on grass tennis courts and will wash away in the first rains.
