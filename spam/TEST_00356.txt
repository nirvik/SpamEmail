Creating chapter names as UTF8 with CFStringGetCString( ...,  
kCFStringEncodingUTF8 ) appears to work OK.
But if I convert an existing chapter name that is not UTF8 encoded I  
get null.

I have changed my code to:

	chapterNameStr	=	CFStringCreateWithCString( kCFAllocatorDefault,  
chapterText, kCFStringEncodingUTF8 );		//	Assume UTF8

	if ( chapterNameStr == nil )
		{
		AECreateDesc(  typeText, chapterText, strlen( chapterText ), &desc );
		err	=	AECoerceDesc( &desc, typeIntlText, &coercedDesc );
		[.....]
		UpgradeScriptInfoToTextEncoding( intlTextPtr->theScriptCode,  
intlTextPtr->theLangCode, kTextRegionDontCare, nil, &encoding);
		chapterNameStr	=	CFStringCreateWithCString( nil, intlTextPtr- 
 >theText, encoding );
		}
	if ( chapterNameStr == nil )  chapterNameStr = CFSTR("");

This was copied from the MoreOSA sample code.
It works better but I wonder if there is a standard way.
