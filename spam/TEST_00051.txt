KDE 4.4 is lighter than KDE 3.5 was, even with desktop effects
enabled. The only time you will see it appear that KDE 4 is "heavy" is
if you are loading the Qt3 libraries in addition to the Qt4 libraries,
for instance by using KDE3 applications. I understand that some people
still need Quanta or the old Kdevelop, but if you are not using KDE 3
applications (and therefore loading Qt3 libraries) then Qt4 is lighter
than Qt3 was.

The issue applies to the alternatives as well, unless you can find a
Qt3 alternative. Gnome and XFCE are both GTK.
