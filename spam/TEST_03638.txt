This time the problem seems to be that I overestimated xine-lib's configure
script as it seems that it doesn't support disabling arts... so if you have
arts-devel installed, its support will be compiled in :-/

Also, I had made another mistake and added the configure option to disable
lirc ot xine-lib when it should have been for xine-ui.

All this is fixed in the upcoming "fr6" release.
