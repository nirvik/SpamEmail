Yes, as someone who has promoted casual use of Linux desktops for a
decade, it has been a major disappointment to see the mail struggles in
our first major foray into business desktop replacement.  Replacing
Exchange has not been a problem but replacing Outlook has been.
Honestly, the blame does not lie all in one place.  It is the
interaction between the client solutions (Kontact/Evolution) and the
Exchange replacement (Zimbra in our case).  I'm hoping we do not need to
replace Zimbra with something else that interacts better as we really do
like Zimbra and think the recent VMWare acquisition will make it even
better.  Thanks - John
