Digital radio playlists are prohibited?!Anyone heard of this law before?

Recently, MusicChoice upgraded their website with a very important 
service, as far as I'm concerned: real-time song info from their 
website. My DirecTV receiver is up on a shelf (and its display scrolls 
intermittently); and I'm surely not going to fire up my projector while 
listening to the "radio", so I'm quite happy that I can retrieve r/t 
song info with URLs like:

http://backstage.musicchoice.com/songid/channels/soundsoftheseasons.asp
http://backstage.musicchoice.com/songid/channels/rap.asp
http://backstage.musicchoice.com/songid/channels/opera.asp
etc...

Now, if I were a more eager hacker, I'd write up little WSDL stubs for 
these event streams (they're clearly not worried about load, since their 
own web pages specify 15 sec meta-refresh) and then feed 'em through a 
content router to alert me to cool songs. Heck, cross-reference the 
service to CDDB and... :-)
