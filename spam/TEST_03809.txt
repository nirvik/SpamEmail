RE: [Baseline] Raising chickens the high-tech wayMy take: if genetic engineering includes selective breeding, then it
also includes human pairs that are not randomly grouped.

It doesn't matter if those two intend what they are doing, they are
engaged in a 'selected sort'.  It has been brought up that a boss no
longer marries his secretary.  Now the female law partner selects
another high earning mate (at least associate law).  So instead of two
couples making $140K a piece (100K + 40K) you have one pair with $200
and one pair with $80 and this has some interesting social effects.  And
one of those effects is the difference in their children (on average).
