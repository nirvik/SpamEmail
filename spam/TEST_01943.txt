Sounds eminently reasonable to me.

You could do that, too.

Or reinstall fresh to the new IDE drive.  Debian is great enough 
that you *never must* reinstall, but it helps by clearing out old 
cruft, etc.

Booting from flash and having the mechanical drives as /home and 
"data" would also work.

Except... /var and /tmp.  They volatile enough that flash probably 
isn't the best place for them to be.  You should put them on small 
"mechanical" partitions.

Sure.  lvm even has a utility to move a PV from one partition to 
another (even though I've never gotten it to work).
