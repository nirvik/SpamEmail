stupid question
hi list,

how do i get rid of the message of a new (of course much valued) 
maintainer Christian about MTA'S and cron when updating squeeze on the 
commandline before using startx? apt-get upgrade hangs on this message 
and i do not know the protocol to go on in this situation (if there is 
any). so i cannot upgrade.

thank you in advance!

steef
