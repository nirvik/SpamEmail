I have a UITableView subclass with a "marking" property (and a
-setMarking:animated: method) to toggle a mode for multiple selection
(a la MobileMail) with the cooperation of a complementary
UITableViewCell subclass. It's modelled after the 'editing' mode, but
distinct from it (which makes retaining the existing swipe-to-delete
behaviour much easier).
