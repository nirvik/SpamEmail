thanks for your answers.  i tried to install xserver-xorg-video-nv on my 
(simple) machine asusrock g41m-s with the bios adapted. i could of 
course install the nv-driver but this driver did not appesr in /etc/X11. 
maybe a hardware problem: a bad card or something like that???

before that i tried (after having used the newest nvidia-driver) it with 
several older nvidia-drivers, startting with the 185 && grom their site. 
no good results: my machine-screens keep freezing with a moving mouse 
and anything else stuck completely. again: a hardware problem???

yut i am not stuck myself. i hung my hanss-g cable on the onboard 
intel-x4500 chip, loaded up xserver-xorg-video-intel and now everything 
is working ok, but somewhat less sophisticated): i can go on keeping the 
books of our business.

please! some further suggestions??


k.r.
