I think this is missing the point a bit...  Yes, you can query the SNMP 
community string...  And yes, it's the default PW (not to mention the 
ESSID and last 5 characters of the default WEP key...)  But they're all 
easily changed, and indeed, it is highly recommended to do so in the 
manual.

Anyone who changes the default settings would not be vulnerable to this 
particular SNMP probe.  Of course, you can't account for end user 
stupidity, but that's beyond the scope of this advisory.  ;)

I've also heard (second hand, but on good authority) that the RG line is 
alive and well (hence the recent RG-1100, and the upcoming 802.11a 
version...)
