Yes, I am sorry for not having been more clear. I wish to monitor my 
Lacrosse WS 3500 meteo station without the original MSWIN program that 
came with it, using Debian Lenny resources if possible. The only thing 
that I really need, is to be able to recuperate the data that is beeing 
stored onto an EEPROM, on to my hard disk, so that I can create 
OpenOffice.org sheets from .csv text files. I don't need continuous 
monitoring.
