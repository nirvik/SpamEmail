Benjamin Wallace Higgins
At 12:45 am Benjamin Wallace Higgins made a crash entry into
 the world. After a night of on again off again activity a C section
 was called for near noon. Seems the little hacker was messing
 with the internal cables and got three turns of the umbilical cord
 around his neck for the effort. Ill have to teach him about the art
 of cable bundling. Benjamin Wallace came out at 6 lbs 13 oz 20
 somthing inches tall and doing what all Higgins boys do best...
 feed and sleep. Mother and Child are doing great.

MOre when I get teh chance. We are in the hospital for 3 days but I have a
free terminal scoped out that now has ssh on it.
