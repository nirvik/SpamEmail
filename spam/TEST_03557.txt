Hi, running it on two different AMD64 Squeeze systems, works fine. I use 
iceowl 1.0b1 (lightning) calendar extension, Adblock Plus 1.1.3, 
contacts sidebar 0.8pre, Image zoom 0.4.4, quote colors 0.3 and a few 
others. One system is even running the "personas" stuff. I also use 
mailbox compacting, Imap and pop.
