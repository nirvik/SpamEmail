...i'm using laptop-mode-tools as an additionally tool to control my
battery power and i would say that it gave me just a bit more time on
battery. You have a  lot of configuration files for controlling
autostart programs and your hardware i.e. cpu, disks,wireless etc.

But you never wil get the same time span as you reache with your windows
OS
