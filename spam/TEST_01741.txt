Thank you.  Since you seem to have SQLite working, I'll focus my efforts on=

testing, documentation, and bug fixing on that.

Really?  It was rejected out-of-hand when I suggested using KDEPIM 4.3.

Quoting: "Move on.  kdepim 4.3 is gone."
Quoting: "KDE 4.4 is the current stable release, there is not much more=20
options here"

I'm not willing to argue feature vs. bug.  Having a KMail with a strong=20
dependency on MySQL in a Debian stable release would be a problem, IMO.  It=
 is=20
especially onerous likely to only affect KMail from KDE SC 4.4.x and not fr=
om=20
earlier or (if progress continues) later releases.
