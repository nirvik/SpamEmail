  Broadly, I was trying to be both vulgar and
ironic. In a "big city" as small as San Francisco
there is, as I believe I stated in the initial
post, maybe ONE PLACE in the whole that they
shoulda kept their heads inside. They were told
to, they didn't, and they got what was coming to
them. I'll feel bad about getting a sick chuckle
out of it maybe when it happens to someone I know
personally. Til then, haw haw haw. Like the
Darwin awards. Get it??
