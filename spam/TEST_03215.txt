Re: NYTimes.com Article: Bigger Bar Code Inches Up on RetailersSure, the *object* of a particular head of lettuce may be unique, but 
we're not tracking lettuce heads -- we're tracking the *idea* of a 
lettuce head in a capitalist system, an ownership relation.

Besides, in the worst case, these damn object ID's aren't very 
compressible. Best representation of a unique head of lettuce I can 
think of is... that very head of lettuce.

Of course, an accumulator is much easier to write, since the Pauli 
Exclusion Principle guarantees that adding a head of lettuce to a bin is 
an _atomic operation_
