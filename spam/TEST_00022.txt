Hi,
1. Check do you have WiFi drivers
2. Install all what was Celejar mention. If you have KDE knetworkmanager 
is ok. In Gnome there is some Gnome variant of network manager and for 
everything else you can use Wicd.
3. Execute iwconfig to check is everything ok

Only tricky part can be driver installation if you have some evil WiFi 
card and sometimes find your router if ssid is hidden.

Troubleshooting steps depends on type of trouble. If you will have some, 
tell us.
