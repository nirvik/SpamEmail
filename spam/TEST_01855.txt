Correct.

Also correct.  In fairness, though I cannot defend the Content-Length: header
as I consider it brain damage in the extreme, Sun inherited this from AT&T.

Specifically, you will need to find a line in /etc/mail/sendmail.cf that
starts with "Mlocal" such as:

[4784] grep ^Mlocal /etc/mail/sendmail.cf
Mlocal,         P=/usr/lib/mail.local, F=lsDFMAw5:/|@qPSXfmnz9E, S=EnvFromSMTP/HdrFromL, R=EnvToL/HdrToL,
[4785] 

and make sure that 'E' appears in the long list of flags following "F=".
If your sys-admin uses m4 to generate sendmail.cf, and any good sys-admin
should, then here is the magic line for the .mc file:

MODIFY_MAILER_FLAGS(`LOCAL', `+E')dnl

Also correct, though procmail per se is not needed, as other filters (such
as slocal, which is part of the [n]mh distribution) do the trick just as well.
