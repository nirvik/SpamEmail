The question is whether these values have been like this from the start.
I think it is a little bit unusual for the drive to have a threshold of
zero for 195-197. And it makes me suspicious that not even attributes 9
and 12 are counted properly.

I think both of these values don't matter to SSDs at all. They shouldn't
care about shocks and don't have a head which could "fly high".

Conclusion: While the warnings indicate a broken disk, they look a bit
fishy to me. It looks the manufacturer used standard firmware from a
regular hard drive and didn't adapt it to SSDs properly. For comparison,
here are *all* values my Intel X25m reports via SMART:

ID# ATTRIBUTE_NAME          FLAG     VALUE WORST THRESH TYPE      UPDATED  =

I think I would try finding and using the manufacturer's diagnostic tool
(which might be a pain without Windows) and see what it reports. I would
expect it to report no problems.

I am no longer prepared to give you the benefit of the doubt.
