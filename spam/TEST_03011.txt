Whither vCard?Does anyone know what happened to vCard support in Netscape 7.0/Mozilla 
1.1?
 (Not there yet in Mozilla and therefore not in the new mail engine I 
presume?)

Netscape Messenger/Mozilla have LDAP LDIF import/export, but I can't 
find vCard or a reference to it anywhere.  I like the Netscape/Mozilla 
email client.  I avoid LookOut for at least two reasons: Windows Only 
(my main environment is Linux with 30% on Windows) and security issues.

Now that LDAP, and the related DSML and DNS SRV record methods, are 
becoming more popular, is there a decline of vCard?
Is there a standard emerging to deal with the mismatch in naming between 
the two?

I've brushed with directories in the past, but I'm getting in deep along 
with more PKI oriented focus.  Any wisdom would be appreciated.  In 
particular, I'm going to start integrating smart cards into my linux and 
Win32 systems and integrating them with Netscape Messenger/Mozilla and 
Outlook.

Thanks
