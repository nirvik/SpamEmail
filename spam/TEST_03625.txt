You'll probably want to buy a retail boxed set, e.g., via mail order.
The only editions of SuSE for i386 that are lawful to duplicate and
redistribute are as follows:

SuSE Evaluation:  This is a single-CD ISO9660 image, currently at v. 7.0. 
If you don't mind having only one disk's worth of SuSE, and being
several revisions behind the boxed-set editions, this is quite good and 
recommended.

SuSE Live Eval:  Another CD image, currently at v. 8.0, but this one
doesn't install to hard drives at all:  It's a demo disk.

SuSE FTP Edition (for lack of an official name):  Not a CD image, but
the contents of ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/suse/i386/current/ .  You would
have to mirror the ftp directory tree, and then figure out how to
install (e.g., over NFS).  Currently at v. 8.0.

There are three (non-redistributable) boxed-set editions, at different
price points.

I'm assuming in the above that you're talking about an i386-architecture
computer.  Slightly different answers apply for Alpha, IA64, SPARC, PPC,
SPARC64, PPC64, or S390.
