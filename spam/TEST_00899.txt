1. romaji, or european languages which
tend to end in vowels, would presumably
work better with attention on the ending
syllable (or at least consonant sound)

2. are typos a larger or smaller space?
I had a whoromatic proggy that scattered
transpositions at hazard where the hands
alternated quickly; that would be a much
smaller space -- but transposing/eliding
spaces might make for a much larger one.
