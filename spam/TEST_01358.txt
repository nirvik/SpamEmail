Thanks for the post there, it answered all my questions about
spamassassin/razor interaction.

Now for a razor question:

I'm worried about having a server full of razor-agent.log files which keep
on growing.  Is it possible to configure razor log via SYSLOG to make it
easy to rotate logs?  Searching through the man pages didn't turn anything
up...  Otherwise I'll have to write a script to go through each user's home
directory looking for razor-agent.log files to rotate periodically.

Thanks,
Dave
