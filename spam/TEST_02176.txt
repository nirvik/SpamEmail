Default kernel settings where changed.  Java applications and some other=20
applications are now binding to IPv6 only, instead of IPv4 and IPv6.  There=
's=20
an open bug about it, IIRC.

I think it was changed in order to allow communication to/from IPv4-embedde=
d-
in-IPv6 addresses over IPv6, which might be required from some environments=
 to=20
function correctly / optimally.  I'm very sketchy on the details because I=
=20
haven't hit the bug myself.
