Re: [ILUG] galeon and keyboard focus...I get a different effect. I open new links in a tab, and they "open in the 
background" or the current page still remains selected. Unfortunately the 
other tab gets the focus. 
The same happens with pages (re)loading in other tabs -> the current tab loses 
the keyboard focus which can be very annoying when filling in forms or even 
when scrolling using the mouse-wheel.

Donncha.
