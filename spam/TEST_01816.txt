Well, I did omit those two reasons, but I didn't forget about them: it is t=
hat=20
I don't consider them reasons to run Sid, much less to counsel anyone else =
to=20
do it.  Neither new hardware nor new software are reasons (on my own regard=
,=20
of course) to run a whole in-development OS (which is what Sid is).

You stay with known-to-work hardware and software on production environment=
s=20
to start with (non-production environments can, of course, qualify on both=
=20
the "peeking into the future" and "for fun" clauses).  If you can't stay on=
=20
the known path, then you backport what you need; this way at least you'll=20
have a clear notice about where your (future) problems are coming from.

And then, if once everything considered it really becomes attractive to go =
for=20
a future, in-development version (basically, too much of a burden on the=20
backporting effort), you still have a case for Testing, not Sid (I for one=
=20
I'm open to consider Testing as an alternative on my workplace... for new=20
projects that can provide strong reasons to do it and once Testing=20
is "frozen" so probably it will already be Stable by the time the project=20
goes "live").

Cheers.
