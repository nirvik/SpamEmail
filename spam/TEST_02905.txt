[ILUG] nmap resultsI had posted previously about the 2.4 kernel using iptables I ran nmap
against. The IPID sequence generation was all zeros. Someone said this was
indicative of earlier kernels but was fixed about 2.4.5 version. Since I'm
running the latest what is causing this? I ran nmap against a 2.2 kernel
using chains and it had better results than the stock 2.4 kernel.
