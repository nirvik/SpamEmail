Dear Dr. Ban,

The creation of the world's fastest physical random number generator, =
the=20
report of nonlinear optics in doped silica glass, and the observation of =

slow light in a long chain of coupled photonic crystal cavities are just =

three of the achievements reported in the December issue of Nature =
Photonics=20

solid-state=20
lasers, and an article looking at how photonics is changing the world of =
dentistry.=20
To accompany this, we have our usual high-quality mix of news, expert =
insights=20
and research highlights from the world of optics. Take a peek inside.
