Say you have installed synaptic-0.24-fr1 on your Valhalla box (package
rebuilt for Valhalla). Then you upgrade to Psyche using the Red Hat CDs.
Hopefully with the compat libraries the package will still be there
(although I doubt that since C++ is binary incompatible, so this is
probably a bad example), then you "apt-get update" with the new Psyche
repository... and there's where the problem will be : It will say that
there are two synaptic-0.24-fr1 packages (one installed, the other
available) with the same version but different dependencies :-/
That's why I always keep package versions lower for older distributions.
