The diagram looks like a typical proxying situation.  If you are trying 
to avoid having someone identify you, it may not work as well as you 
would like.

If your goal is transparency, what you can do depends on your level of 
access and control of server2.  If your goal is of obscurity, it may 
work to a degree, but there have been some news stories lately of, for 
instance, security researchers identifying the IP of people even though 
they went through Tor.

So, yes, it may be possible.
