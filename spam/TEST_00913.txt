I *_was_* confused.

Indeed - that I actually had understood prior
to all this - for example commercial entities
with trial/limited/crippled editions. 

Which is no problem - I don't see why that should
be a problem for SuSE though - surely the 
more the merrrier as far as they're concerned.

Mighty white of you, old bean.

One can suspect what one likes. What I didn't 
understand was that SuSE had proprietary 
extensions that it wasn't prepared to allow
people to use under the GPL or even under  a
FreeBSD style licence.


I thought that the model for the likes of 
SuSE was selling support and customisation, 
rather than what I thought of as the core
"product". I thought that the likes of Yast
came under core - maybe it worked in the glory
days before, say, 2001 - I can understand that
they might want to make more money, but the way
in which they have done it, seems to me, to be 
be against the spirit of the GPL.

All I want is the OS and GNU apps. I was under
the impression that for *_those_* all one
needed was to pay for the media and not for the
code itself?

Ai-je tort?

My understanding was that binaries or whatever
could be received for the cost of the media plus
a token of one's appreciation (the latter being
subject to agreement between the parties) - I was
offering a bottle of wine plus maybe a pint or two
and a chat for a copy - I don't know what the going
rate is.


If I wanted support from SuSE, that would be a
different issue, and one for which I would be
willing to pay.

I have a friend with 7.3 - I think that I'll
end up doing that!

Seems to me to go against the spirit of
the GPL though.

I have now realised this, thanks to your kind
explanations. I can borrow them, but not 
copy them? That's fine - IMHO, it goes against
the spirit of the GPL though.

And why not my own OS, while I'm at it?

And, as I've tried to explain, is not the licence
terms on, say, trials for commercial company x
to which I object, it is the way SuSE appears, 
at least to my I.T. peasant self, to have
mixed up proprietary and open stuff.

Hence my "To hell with SuSE" post...

And I have no problem with people sticking trial
editions along with GPL'ed stuff. Why you 
can't pass those on though, is beyond me.
