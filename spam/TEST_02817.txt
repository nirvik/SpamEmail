[ILUG] How to copy some filesI have about 60G of data which I need to copy from one disk to another.
However, I'm not sure how I should best copy it. The problem is the bulk of
the data is images and most of these image have two directory entries i.e.
there is a hard link to each file. If I copy them using cp -a or my usual
favourite of find .|cpio -pmd other_dir it's going to copy each file twice,
which is not what I want. dump / restore would take care of this if the
source filesystem wasn't reiserfs :-( Any suggestions ?
