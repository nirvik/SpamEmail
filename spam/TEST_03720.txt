Re: Which remote help solution?You could do the following.
1. install ssh server on your friends machine.  Create port forwarding
in their router
Login to their machine as usual using ssh.  To reduce ssh brute force
attack, change the ssh port from 22 to some larger number and use the
corresponding port for router port forwarding.
2. Install openvpn server on your machine, client on your friends
machine. access your friends machine just a like a local machine.

First option is the simplest to setup, it gives only ssh access to you.
Second option takes a bit more configuration, but gives you better
security and ease of use after that.
