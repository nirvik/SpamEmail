That's exactly what is intended; the idea is that legit senders who
habitually score just > 5, will eventually get out of "AWL hell" after
6-10 messages.

Note that running a single spam through "spamassassin -a -t" *will*
eventually whitelist the spammer.  but that's why the man page tells you
not to do it ;)
