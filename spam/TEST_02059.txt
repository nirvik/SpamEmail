I guess it was not very obvious from my first message. My goal is to fix=20
this issue for Squeeze, not for me, but for other users potentially=20
affected by this bug. It won't affect me as I only use unstable on this=20
machine. But in order to help fix it I need to:

1. backport the patch for 2.6.32
2. recompile a standard Debian kernel with the patch included (for=20
testing purposes)
3. report a bug with the backported patch included asking for inclusion=20
in the default squeeze kernel

Unfortunately I lack the skills for 1. and I was asking for comments on=20
whether it is too complicated to pursue:

- if it's trivial I could just go to 3., offer my help for 2. and hope=20
  the kernel team has enough time to do 1.
- if it's doable I could ask on alsa-user or alsa-devel, hoping to find=20
  a kind soul to help
- if it's too complicated I can just drop it since the issue would be=20
  solvable in squeeze by installing a newer kernel from backports (not=20
  ideal)

Hope this explains,
Andrei
