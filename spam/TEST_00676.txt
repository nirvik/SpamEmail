gnome panel tray icons transparancyDear list,

I have Squeeze installed on both a laptop and a desktop, this only
occurs on the desktop.
In gnome, the tray icons on the panel (network manager, rhythmbox
playing, empathy status etc..) are not transparent, the date/time, menu
and application shortcuts are.

Any ideas?
Both installations are up to date.

Best regards,
Steven
