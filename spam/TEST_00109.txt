Apologize for wrong email
Dear Colleague,

this is to inform you that we have had hacker attack on our website.

Most probably you received the invitation email from us, please ignore the email.

For your security, your email addresses are not stolen, so do not worry.

I am apologizing for this situation, but it was out of our control.

Kind Regards
