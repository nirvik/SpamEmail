No.  A matter of support.  Device driver bugs can cause crashes in
apparently unrelated parts of the kernel.  Thus in order to properly
debug kernel problems it is necessary to have complete source.  When you
install a closed-source driver part of the kernel source is hidden from
the kernel maintainers, thus "tainting" the kernel.  The maintainers
suggest that you ask whoever supplied the closed-source code for support
as only they have complete source for the kernel that you are having
trouble with.
