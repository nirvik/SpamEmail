You might be interested in the Pearson packages, which have KDE 3.5.10
with tons of bug fixes backported. It's not for Debian but for
Debian-derived Ubuntu, still, it works:
http://apt.pearsoncomputing.net/

Furthermore, I file bug reports and feature requests for KDE. If you
let me know what problems you are having with KDE 4.4, I will gladly
file issues. KDE 4.0 and 4.1 were a mess, but KDE 4.2 and 4.3 were
very usable. So far as I know KDE 4.4 addresses all but three or four
KDE 3 regression issues. It's also lightweight on hardware (lighter
that KDE 3!) so long as you are not loading Qt3 apps in addition to
the Qt4.

Just let me know what is still broken, and I will see if it can be
taken care of. Thanks!
