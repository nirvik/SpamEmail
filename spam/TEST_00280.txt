Eeeek... I hope they aren't intending to release a new RH with a new gcc
which hasn't yet been released (again). Bad enough the first time, and
I'm sure it gave RedHat a lot of embarrassment.

FWIW, I've yet to compile apt on the gcc 3.2 snapshot in RawHide - apt's
C++ makes several rather poor assumptions on what iterators are, and in
addition doesn't use namespaces at all.

For non-C++ folk, this basically means it needs porting. I've got a
reasonable way along, now, and I'll send a suitable patch to Connectiva
or somewhere when I succeed - I can't find anything on Connectiva's site
itself for this.

In addition, the rpmlib stuff has changed slightly - I've not really
started on this, but it's mainly just arguments added. The rpmlib
documentation seems somewhat poor, though, unless I've missed it.

Dave.
