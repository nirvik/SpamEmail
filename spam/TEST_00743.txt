You could build your own apt-repository. Just mirror the needed directories
(e.g. by using a wget cron job), symlink the needed rpms and recreate the
repository. It is already worth the trouble, if you have more than one
installation.

In any case in order to acces the mentioned places, somebody must keep such a
repository up to date, be it yourself or someone else.
