[Razor-users] What's wrong with the Razor servers now?I noticed a low count of razor'd spam messages. So after digging, if I
razor-report a message the diags say that it was accepted but if I turn
around and run a check on the exact same message that was reported, then
it doesn't find the sig and as such isn't spam.
