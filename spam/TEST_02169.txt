O.k. both of you are right.

Gigabyte AMD based boards seems to follow "0-0-1-1" scheme and Intel ones 
goes "0-1-0-1" but that's all. In both cases, same colored slots indicate 
where to put the matching RAM modules to get a dual-channel setup.

It can be worst, though. There are manufacturers that paint all the RAM 
slots in black or using the same color and so forcing us to read the 
manual >:-)
