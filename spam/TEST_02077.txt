So what brilliant metric do you have in mind to measure unsolicited vs.
solicited commercial email?

I know I've registered for many commercial lists that send material that
really reads like spam.  Moreover, spammers will be able to circumvent
SA if they make spam look like this SCE.  This kind of convergence of the
two.... well, it stinks.  We can kill SCE, or we can cripple
identification of UCE.

Obviously an interim solution is to whitelist, but long term is probably
harder.  What kind of SCE, like MSDN newsletters, product updates, etc
is in the corpus for the GA?  Maybe seeding the corpus with a bigger set
of these type of mails will have some interesting/useful results.
