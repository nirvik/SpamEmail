How unimaginably difficult is this to do?
There are as far as I know, no Linux kernel hackers, nor distros that originate from this fair island right?
Right.

Yes it might be very,very difficult and subject to abject failure 
in sticking together a distro.... call it Dolmen Linux (or other), 
no doubt the packaging system would be one of the first places
 such a suggestion would stumble.
Some (like me) favouring a FreeBSD style ports system others favouring
 a Debian style system and others still favouring *rpm style packaging.

That said other *LUG have done interesting things like making blackbox.

Perhaps making a distro would be ..... umm.... fun.

Just a pseudo random thought.


I'm only laughing on the outside 
My smile is just skin deep 
If you could see inside I'm really crying 
You might join me for a weep.
