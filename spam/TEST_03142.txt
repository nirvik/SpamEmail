At the 1993 ITAC "Roadwork" Conference, Peter Mansbridge asked the
panel of experts how it might be possible to censor the internet.  All
of the panelists laughed except Bill Buxton.  Peter asked him if he
knew something the others didn't.  Bill replied that it /was/ possible
to censor the internet, which drew a gasp from the audience. "All you
need is a global government more Draconian than any that has occured
before in history"

Scientology DMCA suits against Norwegians, legal RIAA file-trading
virii, Bush's Homeland Insecurity, Canada using ISPs as spies, RIAA
suing Prodigy for P2P users and having Foreign sites barred from the
US, France tempers Yahoo, China IP-filters Google ... 

Seems Bill didn't know much about how Government really works.  Either
that, or there's a smelly similarity between Buxton's global Big
Brother and the US and Chinese.
