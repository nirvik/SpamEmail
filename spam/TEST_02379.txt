the check_local tarball includes a program called miltrassassin.
It's a C Milter program speaking the SPAMD protocol so it will be
far more efficient than spamass-milter.
Check http://www.digitalanswers.org/check_local/miltrassassin.html
for some details about miltrassassin.                                                                                                                                                                     
The check_local tarball can be downloaded on
http://www.digitalanswers.org/check_local/beta.html

Another alternative solution is to use Mimedefang : it offers
anti-spam, attachment defanging, custom filtering.
