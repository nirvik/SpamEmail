Another approach would be to get another hard drive (internal SATA if =
you have a Mac Pro, or an external USB or FireWire unit for other Macs =
without additional internal drive bays) and put a clean install of OS X =
on that drive. Going forward you can install DP releases on the =
alternate drive, and keep your main system in a mainstream =
configuration.

You can also repartition your drive, and have two (or more) partitions =
on it, each independently bootable. Back it up first, though.=
