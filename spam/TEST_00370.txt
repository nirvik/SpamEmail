I'm not convinced GNOME is actually involved here. Are you (or the OP)
logging in via GDM? And if so, what session is specified? if "run
Xclient script" or similar, then (as others have said) .xsession is
being invoked as a shell script and GNOME is not being invoked at all.
Default behaviour for some DMs might be to run .xsession if it exists
and pick a default if it doesn't.
