Your sysadmins are wrong.

Whatever program that is used to store the mail into the 
braindead "mailbox" file (/var/spool/mail/whatever) is supposed 
to escape a line that begins with From.  That program is called 
the local Mail Delivery Agent (MDA)

It would be better if you never, ever, stored your mail in a 
"mailbox" file.

If your sysadmins are capable of it, get them to set up the 
receiving Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) to allow the use of procmail 
as the local MDA.  Then use procmail to invoke rcvstore and 
deliver your mail directly into your MH mail folders.

Most Linux systems come configured this way, if a user has a
$HOME/.procmail file then mail is delivered using procmail.
