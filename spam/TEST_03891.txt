You have that option always.  Decode it user flac decoder to wave
file, then downsample it.  You could encode it back to mp3/ogg etc.
There are many programs to do downsampling.  I think even the
lame/oggenc support downsampling.
Otherwise install the package "samplerate-programs" and sndfile-resample
