Subject: Recruiting for PAIII-IV Supervisor



Dear SoE Community,

Forgive the spam, but I wanted to make sure that everyone is aware that
we are recruiting to replace the position vacated by Gary Moro.

This is a technical position with supervisor responsibilities. The focus is
on Solaris and Linux systems administration with Veritas and Irix experience
a plus.

The posting is here:

Regards,

Michael Perrone
