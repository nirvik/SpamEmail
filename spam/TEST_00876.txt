Users could rebuild KDE from SVN but if we were so
inclined we wouldn't be Debian users.

Debian already has done all the work and maintains all
the infrastructure.  It's vastly less work for Debian
to rebuild KDE 3.5 when a library changes rather than
force users to try to create a new build infrastructure.

Debian ships all sorts of software, including even
non-free software.  Would it be possible to continue
rebuilding and shipping KDE 3.5, perhaps in "contrib",
perhaps with a huge "no security updates" disclaimer?
