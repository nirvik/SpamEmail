Linux (and Unix, for that matter) does not have the concept of the "job"

Business-oriented operating systems (like OpenVMS, MVS/OS, OS/400 
and other legacy systems) do, but any operating system without a 
batch queue (which is, naturally, to where you submit jobs) can not 
have "jobs".

(No, cron does *not* count.  It's a piss-poor imitation.)
