I wanted to add a different command line solution. I use mplayer a lot
to watch videos, so I have an mplayer recipe to do this same job.  It
goes like this:

    mplayer myvideo.avi -vc null -vo null -ao pcm:file=myvideo.wav

This is just another option. I think mplayer makes some things easier
because it chooses codecs for you. If mplayer can play your file, it
can also write it to disk.

Hope this helps,

Phil
