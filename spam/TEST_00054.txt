rdesktop segmentation faultWe have found that the Lenny rdestkop-1.6.0-2 package seg faults
reliably when using seamlessrdp.  In fact, it seg faults on every other
access.  Apparently this is a known problem.  We did apply the known
patch. It works and we have packaged internally as rdesktop-1.6.0-2.1.
Should we do anything with this package in case others are also using
seamlessrdp? What is the Debian protocol? Thanks - John
