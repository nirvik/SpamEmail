RE: [Razor-users] What's wrong with the Razor servers now?Thanks that helps.  There's still so little info on TES and those of us
here since RazorV1 know how it works.  I did set my min_cf to "ac-100"
which I thought would be zero.  

So the way you are suggesting that it works now is that everyone has a
trust level of 1 and have to work their way up.  Your trust level
increases when someone nominates the same message as spam. This must
have been the new changes made at the beginning of the week unless the
changes dumped everyone's trust level.  Now here come the questions...

What engine signature does TES look at?  Does it have to be the same e1
signature or does it use the e2 or e4 signatures.  How many people have
to nominate the message before everyones rating increases?  How many
revokes decreases someones rating?  Does a single revoke decrease the
rating of everyone that nominated the message?  If a newby reports a
message that has already been reported does their trust level
immediately go up?  In the case of revoking, does someone with a trust
level of 1 have the capability to revoke a message submitted by multiple
people with higher trust levels?

Bobby, 

Couple of things: 

If you are not a trusted reporter, your reports will not have an
immediate effect. It takes a bunch of trusted reporters to bump up the
confidence of a signature to a point where it is considered to be spam.
This might be frustrating initially, but as the number of trusted users
grows the time delay between nominations and determination will become
shorter. Of course, it's a lot more frustating for people to have their
legit mail filtered out due to incorrect reporting.

Also, for the purpose of testing, I'd suggest making your min_cf (in
razor-agents.conf) to 0. min_cf defaults to the server recommended
average confidence, which at the moment is 1. Setting min_cf to 0 should
return true for whatever you submit (as long as it was not revoked by a
trusted user).

apt/fire sync with honor every 5 minutes, so you'd have to wait for a
_maximum_ of 5 minutes before signatures propagate.

cheers,
vipul.
