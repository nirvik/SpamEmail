Thanks Jeremy.

Unfortunately neither the software or operating system is supported 
anymore. I prefer the old software to the current alternative (and 
already have the licenses), and the SGI platform is so reliable. The 
computers are at least 12 years old and the Bruker XwinNMR program, was 
replaced about 5-6 years ago!

It is also unfortunate that this was handled so nicely by the old X11. I 
haven't yet tried installing the Tiger X11 on a Snow Leopard machine - 
would the instructions for doing this under Leopard still work?

Phil.
