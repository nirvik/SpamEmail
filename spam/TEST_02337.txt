Turning on/off webcam IR ledsHello all!

I'm planing to buy a webcam with infrared LEDs. I wonder if turning
on/off IR leds can be controlled on debian? Which webcams are
supported to do that?

I'm looking forward to buy Genius iSlim 321R (details:
http://www.genius-europe.com/en/produktdetail.php?ID2=82&ID=31&ID3=490
), but I will be glad if somebody recommend me another similar model
with IR leds which is known to work on linux.

(if it matter, I use debian testing release)
