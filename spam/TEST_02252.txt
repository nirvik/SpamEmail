[SAtalk] Huh?Despite my lack of confidence to upgrade to 2.41 using the tarball instead of 
cpan, it worked.  With the help of others, got razor working.  I did however 
notice something in my logs which happened twice but hasn't recurred.

Sep  8 16:10:11 omega spamd[14014]: razor2 check skipped: Permission denied 
Can't call method "log" on unblessed reference at 
/usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.6.1/Razor2/Client/Agent.pm line 211, <STDIN> line 
66.

The only certainty about documentation is that
whoever wrote it "might" have understood it.
The rest of us may not be so lucky.
