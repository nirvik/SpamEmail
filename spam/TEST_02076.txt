SQLite or Virtuoso might be interesting to reduce resource footprint.

And it would be nice if Akonadi works via NFS, where at least regarding=20
the wiki MySQL's inno db tables might be a problem. I asked on kde-pim and=
=20
kdepim-users mailing lists. And got quite some feedback. Apparently it=20
might just work if only one Akonadi is running and the network environment=
=20
and nfs servers are stable. Fair enough for now. KMail never worked in=20
mutiple instances.

And one user pointed out that its possible to use a central MySQL server=20
with local filesystem for Akonadi stuff.

Well let's see.
