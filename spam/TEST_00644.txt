AUGD: Re: Displaying iPad/iPhone/iPod touch for video projector> We've used a TV camera hooked up to our projector to shoot/display an iPhone. It's a bit clunky. I was hoping for a better solution with the iPad. 

I found a great solution at the Consumer Electronic Show . . . the HoverCam Document Camera has worked well at our user group meetings when plugged via USB into my MacBook Pro 17" connected to a VGA digital projector. . . for scanning up to 600 dpi, I recommend the HoverCam X500.

There are two models (X300 and X500) that look exactly alike which I extensively reviewed at http://applejac.typepad.com/applejac_macintosh_users/2010/02/hovercam-digital-age-multiscanner.html.

When using either, I recommend using a white background (not the black mat which it comes with), and reducing the brightness on the iPad (or iPhone or iPod touch or Android or whatever) to about 25% due to the extreme sensitivity of the scanner lense.
