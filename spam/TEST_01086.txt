There is a lot of C++ in the embedded world. With
static object allocation and a few other programming
techniques, performance differences disappear, but
C++ gives a boost in development and maintainability.
The real issue is compiler availability. Almost every
embedded platform has C cross-compilers. Many have
C++ compilers. But there is still a range of
platforms that have the first but not the second. Or
at least, that was the story a few years ago.
