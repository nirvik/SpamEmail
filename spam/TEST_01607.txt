For a long time I have used an external editor with exmh (gvim).

I can cut'n'paste from exmh's message display window into spawned
gvim processes, but not into anything else.

This is VERY annoying.

  (I have to look at the message with cat or less or whatever in a
  terminal window if I want to do this - which is quite often.  And
  if the message is q-p encoded or a non-text/plain mime type, I end
  up with all that raw garbage too).

Anyway to fix this?

(BTW: standard i386 redhat7.3)

Thanks.
