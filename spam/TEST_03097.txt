Using Niall's example - single set of files but >1 namespace, and suppose that
you want to delete some items from the set according to rules applied to the
namespaces.  With soft links you need an *extra* namespace the others refer to,
and after filtering the namespaces, you have to do a manual reference count to
decide what goes and what stays.  With hard links, you just unlink and deletion
is automatic.
