I think I've seen something similar with Pardus, but not recently (i.e.
not since they went from 4.2.4 to 4.3.4). As I recall what was happening
was that if I put a widget on the bottom or right of the screen it
jumped towards the middle, almost as if it couldn't cope with
coordinates beyond a 1024x768 (or thereabouts) screen. I also saw the
same behaviour on Ubuntu with similar vintage. In both cases it didn't
always happen. Not quite sure if this is the same behaviour that you are
describing.
