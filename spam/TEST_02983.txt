[ILUG] RE: When is a WAV not a WAV? ANS: It is?!?Well, after playing around with these strange wav files I realised I didn't 
even have sox installed. A quick apt-get install sox fixed this.

Sox does reconise these AND even plays them in stereo! Following info from 
the CD-Writing HOW-TO I used sox to convert the Sgt Pepper's wav to cdr and 
wrote it to CD and now I've got a CD with ONE track that is the entire Sgt 
Peppers Album! Not too sure how over 500M of cdr reduces to only 51M of wav 
file but there it is?!?!

And I've got loads of Beatles Albums and singles in these strange wav files!

KEWL! Now I don't need to go buying them!

Cheers,

	John Gay
