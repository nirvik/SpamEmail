Apache2, some variable with "domain name"?Hi all!
I have a virtualhost definition with a lot ServerAlias values. I want
to have a specific alias for any of this ServerAlias. Would be perfect
if apache2 stores the domain name in som variable in order to use it
to make a single AliasMatch instance for all ServerAlias.

Something like:

AliasMatch ^/webalizer /home/httpd/webalizer/$domain


Have Apache2 anything like $domain var?

Thanks!!
