[ILUG] The Age Old 'Which Mailer' QuestionI am trying to manage the email for a domain which I have hosted with
hosting365, and am trying to get the whole email send and receive thing
working nice and easily.
At the moment I have configured Fetchmail to poll the different pop3
mailboxes and deliver the mail accordingly, although it appears that I have
to have only one unix user being able to receive from each pop3 mailbox.
This could be a limitation of the fetchmailconf programme, I'm not sure, but
It would be much handier if I could just tell it to collect all of the mail
from the different mailboxes, and then deliver it locally according to the
"To:" header instead of the pop3 mailbox it came from.
The other issue I am having is sending outgoing mail.  I have been trying to
use sendmail, but am finding it to be an absolute pain in the posterior, and
when the relay server will only accept outgoing connections if I have
checked for incoming mail in the last twenty minutes, and I don't know how
to set sendmail to run a command before it sends out the mail.  Do any of
the outgoing mailer programs, exim or postfix or whatever, have a 'nice'
configuration interface, or do they all have nice friendly configuration
files like sendmail.

Any suggestions of alternative solutions would be much appreciated.  There
are only three or four email addresses in my domain, and setting it up for
scheduled collection and either scheduled or immediate delivery would do me
fine.

Thanks,

	David.
