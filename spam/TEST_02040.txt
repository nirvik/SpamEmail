Well, I am using WEP, not WPA, but that is, essentially, the messages that I get in daemon.log, as well..  I tried to turn WEP off then back on again.  The first time that I tried this, it actually worked.  I was able to connect.  Once I disconnected, however, I could not reconnect, even after turning security off and then on again.  Up until last Monday;s update this was working fine.  On RARE occasions I would have this kind of problem, but simply turning the router off, then back on would fix it.  That no longer works, however.  I will again point out that this same laptop connects to my wireless just fine if I use the OS which must not be named, or if I boot into eeebuntu 3.0.  Also, I can connect from Debian on this laptop with unsecured networks and also with OTHER WEP secured networks.  I tried a different WEP secured network today and it connected automatically, just like it should.  But it still will not connect to my home wireless network.  

The other problems that started after Monday's update have since been solved, but this one remains and is quite annoying.  If anyone has any other ideas, I would appreciate hearing them.
