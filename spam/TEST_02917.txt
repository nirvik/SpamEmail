Think of all the people and places that would not get unsolicited mail
if we hadn't invented them.  Though perhaps ordering a free Enron mug
as the King of Hell....

I think it's like P3P met whatever commercial /.like forum was rocking
yesterday, and they took all Greg's extra serotonin and lit up and
made a Successful go of personal address palettes you could occupy and
own or rent and even move or sell.  So you'd reply to all the whitepaper
sites you wouldn't just call to get the real deal like: 'Okay, let's say
I'm in Factorytown, GuangZhou, and I'm a battery acid supervisor for
a multinational that sometimes buys B1s.  e-mail me if you get your story
written up all the way;' or
	'Today, I'm a 200lb, 3m tall mophead with pearlecent teeth
and excellent sex-linked features, but who uses Solaris nntp clients.  Got it?'
 or merely
	'I can't read Base64 messages.  I use small alphabets and
8-letter words that didn't come from the bible and use calculus, and
I'd thank you to class me as a Catamite.'

N3kk1D PRR3zzEw33Lz ahR 3V1L, but I thought it had to do with
coldfusion-compatiblie plugins (servlets, whatever) that overhyped
unimplemented features.  Repeatedly.  Openly.  In rakish 10MB
branding-first downloads that meshed well with budgeting policies.
