Just read this so don't know if you're writing about squeeze?

Had some problems, so changed my /etc/fstab file dvd to /dev/sr0
because blkid wouldn't pick it up.

/dev/sr0       /media/cdrom0   udf,iso9660 user,noauto     0       0

Then things started to work again.

Just in case this may help you.

Be well,
Charlie
