I don't know what the 10M3050 developer preview is, so I guess that's a 
"no".

from Apple Inc."  Also, under "about:plugins" I see the version of the 
Java NPAPI plugin is 13.1.0.

I'm going to send you a screen grab of the rendering error I'm seeing in a 
separate message that's not cc'd to java-dev.  Interestingly, if I grab 
the applet window, I get the clipped applet display stretched to fit the 
size of the entire applet window.  If I grab the firefox window, I just 
get the firefox window display.  I guess this makes sense since the applet 
runs in a separate process, though I don't understand why the applet 
display is getting messed up.  Maybe this is a clue to where the problem 
lies.
