I agree wholeheartedly.  It is easier to sit on knowledge than to
continually acquire more on the frontiers.

This is in fact very true.  People hate doing this for several reasons in
my experience:
1) "Software changes.   Why waste time writing a FAQ now that will be out
of date at the next release in 3 months?"
2) "This knowledge is specialized.  Only 4 people need to know this, and
they already do.  If anyone else needs to know it they know who they can
call."
The same engineers who give these excuses will spend eternities on the
phone discussing this arcana and sharing the knowledge with anyone who has
the patience to ask.

The strongest contributors freely share everything they know whenever
asked (or whenever they see the need for the information in the company)
and who at the same time continue to generate new knowledge.

Personal evaluation: my worth comes slightly lower on the scale in that I
synthesize the knowledge from various personal sharing exercises into
usable documents and messages for the company to employ.  This would seem
like a marketing exercise except that Marketing is useless.   Useful
knowledge sharing comes (IMHO) from engineering and sales.
