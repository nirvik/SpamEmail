  That'll show packages that are available from sid and that are
installed on your computer.  That could include packages you installed
from testing, but that are also available from sid.  If you want to
check that the installed version is also available from sid, you'll need
to wrap it in '?narrow':

$ aptitude search '?narrow(?archive(unstable), ?installed)'
