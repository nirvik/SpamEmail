Can't read DVDFrom nobody Tue Nov  5 01:33:28 2013
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

I'm not able to read DVDs in squeeze. I burned this disc on the same
drive in squeeze. Thereafter it worked fine until a week or so ago
(the disc is less than a month old). I tested the disc last week on a
windoze and mac osx and it worked without a problem.

When I try to mount the cd/dvd rom drive:
stuckey@debian:~$ mount /dev/scd0
mount: block device /dev/sr0 is write-protected, mounting read-only
mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/sr0,
      missing codepage or helper program, or other error
      (could this be the IDE device where you in fact use
      ide-scsi so that sr0 or sda or so is needed?)
      In some cases useful info is found in syslog - try
      dmesg | tail  or so


In DMESG I see:
