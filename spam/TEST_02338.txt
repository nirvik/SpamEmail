Are you running the NPAPI Plugin2 using the 10M3050 developer preview? =
Visually, it looks pretty good to me in FF 3.6.3 on 10.6.3 (there are =
some event issues like scrolling and right click - but I'm not seeing a =
clipping issue).

What version of Java does your browser think it's running (you can =
search for "what version of java do I have")?
