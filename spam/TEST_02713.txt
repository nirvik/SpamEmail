It would seem so, both look the same apart from this issue, and both are
using 'Clearlooks'.
I noticed however that the option for Clearlooks in 'System -
Preferences - Appearance' are slightly different (tab 'Theme'), on the
laptop I see the debian icon on some themes, whereas on the desktop I
see a folder icon instead.
Changing the theme doesn't help.

Yes, as I said, both are running Squeeze, and using the same download
mirror for apt, both are up to date. I take Rhythmbox for example, both
are at 0.12.8, but the icon that appears when playing is only
transparent on the laptop.

Creating a new panel with notification area keeps showing the issue on
this new panel.

A new user has the same issue.
