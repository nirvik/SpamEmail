You should look into the live-helper configuration and adjust where it gets=

the kernel source and any (extra?) patches it applies.  It should be able t=
o=20
work with kernel sources provided from lenny-backports with the proper=20
configuration, since it already works with both Lenny and Squeeze kernel=20
sources.  The bpo kernels are not packaged significantly differently.

If live-helper doesn't have any relevant configuration, looking into how it=
=20
receives, patches, compiles, and packages the kernel should give you some=20
insight into a work-around.  (e.g. repackaging the bpo kernel package to ha=
ve=20
the same package name but a higher version than the Lenny kernel package.)
