Is this something along the same line as ORBS?
I remember not so long ago when eircom was put
on the ORBS list, half the ISP's in Europe wouldn't
accept mail from my address. Of course, informing
Eircom of this did nothing for about 4 months or so.

IMHO stopping spammers is a great idea but I'd rather
have to hit d or delete rather than have my messages
bounced by someone else's ISP.
