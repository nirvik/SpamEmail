I thought this, too, until recently when working with companies which
use PDF heavily.  I had always used KPDF as it seemed so much lighter
and faster than acroread.  However, it has only a very small portion of
the full functionality of acroread.  I had never noticed but our clients
did.

It's everything from small things (like mousing into to lower left
corner and seeing the document size -very handy for non-standard sizes
such as construction drawings) to the massive printing problem that
afflicts all other Linux pdf readers - at least in Lenny, no pdf reader
could print non-default print sizes.  No matter what we did, every
single PDF reader we tried insisted on printing to the default paper
size.  Apparently this is a well known bug from the hours of searching
we did.  Only acroread would let our client print their construction
drawings without shrinking them down letter or A4 size - John
