[ILUG] PNP collision avoidance questionHi all,
      I have an ISA PNP card that will use io 0x200 if available.  If located at
0x200 the card never works, at 0x210 it always does.  I suspect the problem is
the soundcard (Creative SB PCI-64) gameport controller, which also seems to live
here.  I'm not using the controller, so it doesn't show in /proc/ioports, so
autodetect happily puts my ISA card there.
      I can get the card to work easily enough using isapnptools, banning the
0x200 range in /etc/isapnp.gone, and then using "insmod radio-cadet io=0x210",
but I'd like to get the autodetect working, so what I think I'm looking for is
some way of adding "don't go here, don't bother me" entries into /proc/ioports.

Anybody?

TIA,
Ronan.
