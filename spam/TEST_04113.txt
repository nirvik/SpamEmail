Kiosk mode in .qtl not working properly in Quicktime X PlayerHi.

I have Quicktime Link files (.qtl)  on a server that refer to another  
movie on the server.

If I open the .qtl file with Quicktime Player 7 it works properly,  
the user can't save the movie or cut and copy the movie.

If I open the .qtl file in Quicktime Player X the menu choices for   
'save as...' ,  'save for web...' and the 'Share' menu choices  
'iTunes...' 'MobileMe Gallery...' and YouTube...' are enabled.
However  If I chose them the movie starts to save but then will get  
an error.

Save as... and Share>Itunes . generate OSStatus error-38
save for web generates OSStatus error-108

It does not result in the movie being saved but the interface  
indicates it can be done.  Can Quicktime player X save movies which  
have Kiosk mode set as true?
