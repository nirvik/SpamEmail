Were you running that command as "root" (or sudo) user?

Uh? So it works fine for root user...

O.K., Let me check with my USB flash drive. After I plugg it:

***
sm01@stt008:~$ mount | grep fat
/dev/sdc1 on /media/disk type vfat (rw,nosuid,nodev,uhelper=hal,shortname=lower,uid=1000)
***

I try to umount it:

***
sm01@stt008:~$ umount /media/disk
***

And now I verify it has been "really" umounted:

***
sm01@stt008:~$ mount | grep fat
***

Seems to be working here for my plain user.

You can check 2 more things:

- Permissions of the mounted device ("mount" will tell)

- Does this happen whith any kind of media you connect in USB ports (USB 
flash drives, media devices, etc...) or just happens with a concrete 
device?

There can be operations left in background that may prevent umounting the 
device... "lsof" will tell.
