Re: Problem with me Modem Huawei on Debian LennyHi
I have a different 3g usb modem, and I have found after .31 there is a
problem loading the firmware into the device. maybe you are running
into the same problem.

There was a change to the qcserial - there is a regression bug again
32+ which make the firmware fail.
