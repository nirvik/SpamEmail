Well I have tried it multiple times and it keeps coming up with


[VT/dev/pts/0 wtopa@dj-SQUEEZE]
~$ /usr/lib/icedove/run-mozilla.sh: line 131:  8812 Segmentation fault 
     "$prog" ${1+"$@"}


When looking at that line # it does not jive with the error shown though.

Maybe something missing in Squeeze that was not included in
the depends?

Good thing I still had the old version in the archives.  :-)
