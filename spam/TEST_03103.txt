There are competing products to Acrobat Standard; they're not free
though. But the problem is not that other's can't; it's just that most
people don't realize what a complex bit of software engineering
developing a PDF editor is; if it's to be useful at all.

Check out acrobatuser.com where vendor products for Acrobat other than
just Adobe are often reviewed/discussed/used.
