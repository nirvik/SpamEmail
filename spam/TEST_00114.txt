Heh. The name of the band is SO appropriate...:)

I, hate the rain and sunny weather
And I, hate the beach and moutains too
(and) I don't like a thing about the city, no, no
And I, I, I, hate the country side too!

And I, hate everything about you!
...everything about you!

I don't like a thing about your mother
And I, I hate your daddy's guts too
I, don't like a thing about your sister
'cause I, I, I, think sex is overrated too.

And I, get sick when I'm around, I, can't stand to be around
I, hate everything about you!

everything about you, everything about you, everything about
you

Some say I got a bad attitude
But that don't change the way I feel about you
And if you think this might be bringing me down
Look again cause I ain't wearin' no frown!

I don't really care about your sister
Fuck the little bitch 'cause I already kissed her

One thing that I did to your lady
Put her on the bed and she didn't say maybe
I know you know everybody knows
The way it comes, the way it's gonna' go

You think it's sad
And that's too bad
'cause I'm havin'
A ball hatin'
Every little thing about you!

Everything about you, everything about
I get sick when I'm around
I can't stand to be around
I hate everything about you
