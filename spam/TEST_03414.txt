I started to dig into this again since the QuickTime bug is not fixed =
yet :-(

And yes, exporting using the Apple Intermediate Codec and then to iPod =
works. But it's not a good solution.

Are there any other kind of track that could hold some images and =
decompress to '2vuy'?

Any ideas are welcome.
