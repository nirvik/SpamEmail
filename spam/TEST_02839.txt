I have this Debian-Live system that I took from Lenny to Squeeze, 
nothing to lose so I did a full Sid upgrade, of course yawp was removed, 
so I installed kweather and got Weather Forecast to work, no problems to 
report.

Funny they are still using the name kweather, it's no longer a valid 
applet or widget, but needed to get plasma weather widgets to work.
