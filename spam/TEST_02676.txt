Not necessarily. KDE has a regular release schedule, with a point
release about once a month. I would consider a distro that included
the latest point releases stable in the sense of no (or few) beta
software.

I have tested KDE in a VM in the past, it doesn't work out. I need to
use it for everyday work.

Yes, there is a lot of favour towards Mandriva and Suse. Kubuntu with
Project Timelord is also being mentioned. If I jump ship from a Debian
based distro, it will likely be to Suse.
