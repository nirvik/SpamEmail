Re: Tech's Major Decline
I'm not sure which way to make
the old bits call on this:

[A] <http://www.xent.com/pipermail/fork/2002-September/014448.html>
was posted well after
[B] <http://www.xent.com/pipermail/fork/2002-August/014351.html>
was in the archives, but then
again, [B] didn't bother with
any commentary (new bits).

If you two can agree upon who
was at fault, penance will be
to explain how feedback phase
is affected by time lags, and
tie that in to the spontaneous
generation of "business cycles"
in the Beer Game. *

in which the scenario 4 (margin
