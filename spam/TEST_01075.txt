Barbie has been made over as a Bond girl:  

    [IMG: http://www.craphound.com/images/bondbarbie.jpg] As James Bond, Ken 
    has matured nicely with rooted hair, with slight silvering at his temples, 
    wearing a midnight blue tuxedo, and authentic recreation of the classic tux 
    by Brioni, the famed clothier. Linda Hemming, the award winning costume 
    designer in charge of this year's James Bond film, outfits Barbie doll. She 
    wears a blood red gown with a glittering gold lace overlay and a gauzy red 
    shawl with a gold filigree design. Her gown is cut up the side to reveal 
    lots of leg as well as not so discreet hip strap that anchors Barbie's cell 
    phone. The set is slated for release in November, to coincide with the 
    premiere of "Die Another Day," the new James Bond film. Bond, James Bond, 
    meet Barbie, just Barbie...
