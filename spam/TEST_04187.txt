Flat directory structures became obsolete 30 years ago.

So, before migrating to xfs *just because it supports 64000 
folders*, ask yourself and the users, "Why the heck do we have 32000 
sub-directories in the first place???"

You all should (with some research and planning) be able to 
reorganize that sprawling flat structure into a significantly nested 
structure.
