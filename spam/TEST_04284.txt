When I try to run it a second time from the shortcut generated by JWS, it tries to run the application with Java 5 and fails.  Is there a way to get the shortcut to select the correct JVM?

I have since solved this issue.  Apparently you can't use full version 
strings, like "1.6.0_14+", you have to use just "1.6+".  Not sure if 
that's intentional or not.  The "1.6.0_14+" string was copied correctly 
to the Info.plist file, but apparently wasn't parsed correctly?
