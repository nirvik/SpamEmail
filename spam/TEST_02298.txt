Subject:	[SAtalk] user_perfs


I am having troubles setting up the User_Perfs file and I know it is reading them, 
cause if I change the score value it works based on the changes.  My questions has 
to do with allowing certain domains not to be scanned for spam for a certain mbox.  I 
can not get to the spamassassin.org site to check.

Question:

Is this the correct way to code it?

# Whitelist and blacklist addresses are now file-glob-style patterns, so
# "friend@somewhere.com", "*@isp.com", or "*.domain.net" will all work.
whitelist_from  *@freelotto.com
whitelist_from  *@luckysurf.com

Thanks!!
Jim
