Making money is NOT a bad thing for User Groups to do.  Often the  
thing that will make money will also be good for the members.
And the money raised doesn't have to go back to individuals - it can  
be plowed back in to the club itself and provide additional services  
for the members.

I agree wholeheartedly that the FCP are currently in a slightly  
different league to the 'traditional' User Groups.
Part of that is because the adopted a very different approach to the  
way they run themselves and the audience they target.
They provide the services that their members want , yet the group  
makes some money from it

Oh, I agree 1000% with your statement about groups still debating to  
support Classic Users... it is probably already to late for those  
groups. They took toooooo long to evolve and will become extinct  
sooner rather than later.

But changes can't happen over night either.

For example, there are hints that Apple are pulling back on their  
support of Mac OS X... eg No Apple Designs Awards for Mac OS X  
developers this year - yet they have a new category for iPad  
developers already!

So User Groups should be looking at supporting iPad users sooner  
rather than later... and I said the same sort of thing 10 years when  
Apple introduced Mac OS X... many groups then were slow to embrace Mac  
OS X and they continued to inform their members who to perform certain  
things under Classic rather than Mac OS X even after Steve Jobs held  
the funeral for Mac OS 9... they were slow to evolve and many groups  
weren't in a position to support new Apple users who never knew  
Classic and only had Mac OS X on their shiny new systems.

The Disc of the Month is an entire separate topic that I'm planning on  
covering in a few weeks times.

But the main argument FOR newsletters and DotM is the internet is so  
vast it is impossible to be aware of everything that is available out  
there. Newsletters and DotMs can help point members in the right  
direction for finding other resources

Also, American's need to understand that not everyone has 'unlimited'  
broadband internet access. Here in Australia we pay through the nose  
for plans that have traffic quotas - some ISPs even count uploads as  
part of that quota... some charge $150+ per gigabyte for 'excess'  
usage... others throttle the connection speed down to a mere 64K if  
you exceed the monthly quota... they even break the quota allowance up  
into peak and off-peak times

And I understand Australia is not unique in these practices.
