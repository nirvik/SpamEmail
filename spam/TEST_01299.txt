Speeds on my md-RAID devices were comparable to speeds with my Areca HW RAI=
D=20
controller (16-port, PCI-X/SATA, battery powered 128MB cache).  Number of=20
drives varied from 5 to 10.  RAID levels 5 and 6 were both tested.

Read throughput for both were the expected (# drives - # parity drives) *=20
single drive throughput.  Write throughput less than expected in both cases=
,=20
but I can't recall the exact figures.

Both support "just yank the drive out" if the (rest of) the hardware suppor=

hot plugging.  Alerting about failure is probably a bit better with a HW RA=
ID=20
controller, since it comes with visual and audible alarms.

It might be different when the system is under load, since the md-RAID depe=
nds=20
on the host CPU and the HW RAID does not.  However, adding an additional=20
generic CPU (to reduce load) is both more useful and often less expensive t=

buying a HW RAID controller that is only used for RAID operations.

I know I am.
