Accounting Officer,

Centre, 18 Harcourt Road, Central,
Hong Kong.

Dear Friend,

I am Mr.Chow Woo,Accounting Officer
Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi,Hong Kong.
I have a sincere and very confidential
business proposition for you.

On october 6th 1999,a British consultant/contractor
with the Chinese Ministry of Agricuture,
Mr. David J. Woodbin made a (Fixed) Deposit for
twelve calendar months, valued at US$16,600,000.00
(Sixteen Million six hundred United State Dollars only)
in my branch.

Upon maturity,I sent a routine notification to
his forwarding address but got no reply. After a
month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered
from his contract employers, the Chinese Ministry of
Agriculture that Mr. David J. Woodbin died after a brief
illness on postrate cancer. On further indept investigation,
I found out that he died without notifying anybody about
the deposit in my bank.This sum of US$16,600,000.00
is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being
rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each
year. No one will ever come forward to claim it.

According to the Hong Kong Law,under the Chinese constitution
at the expiration of 8(eight) years,such funds will
revert to the ownership of the Government
for financing military operations on defence affairs,
such as purchasing of arms and ammunitions for the military.

Inorder to avert this negative development,i will
like to seek for your permission as a foreigner to
stand as the next of kin to Mr. David J. Woodbin so
that the fruits of this old man's labor will not
be use for financing weapons which will further
enhance the courses of war in the world in
general.

The money will be paid into your account for us to
share in the ratio of 50% for me,40% for you
on your assistance and 10% for charity organisations.
There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this
transaction will be done by my attorney and with my
position as the Accounting Officer,guarantees the
successful execution of this transaction.
If you are interested, please reply immediately,
so that we can commence on the processes.

Upon your response, I shall then provide
you with more details and that will help
you understand the transaction.

You should observe utmost confidentiality,
and rest assured that this transaction would
be most profitable for both of us because I
shall require your assistance to invest my share
in your country.

Awaiting your urgent reply.

Thanks and regards.

Mr.Chow Woo
