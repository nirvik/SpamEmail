I'm not familiar with partimage. Are you saying that it refuses to allow
you to backup partitions with names such as "/dev/vg/home" or
"/dev/mapper/vg-home"?

That's because it's a byte-for-byte copy.

Go back and read what I wrote about dd. You *really* ought to specify
a blocksize (for example, bs=100k).

You probably needed to have updated the disk partition table, too.

That suggests that sdc1 is a raw LVM partition, which you would not be
expected to mount as a filesystem. Are you SURE you're trying to dd from
a filesystem image and not from an underlying LVM segment?


It seems to me that you may be very confused (maybe you don't even know
it?!). If you want specific advice, please can I ask that you run these
commands (as root) and post the output.

    for D in /dev/[hs]d[a-z]; do fdisk -l "$D"; done
    mdadm -v --examine --scan
    pvdisplay | grep Name
    lvdisplay | grep Name
    mount | grep ^/dev/

This will give us a view on what Disk/RAID/LVM/Filesystem combinations
you actually have.
