I don't think there is a specific word in English for eye goop. 
However, when I was halfway literate in Tagalog, I learned that there is
a specific word in that language (or was it another dialect?) for it:
muta, pronounced "MOO-ta".  Even though my Tagalog has faded greatly, I
automatically use that word for "eye goop" when speaking English (how
often does that happen?), mostly because it apparently filled a
linguistic hole in my brain and therefore permanently wedged itself into
my vocabulary.

Not that this is important, but I've inadvertently adopted "muta" into
my version of the English language as the word for "eye goop".  Arguably
better than "smegma" anyway.
