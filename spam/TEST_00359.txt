Configuring X for second monitor running free-driver.Good day.


Could You please help me with my X server config.

I'm trying to use only external monitor connected to a laptop and all is fine except that I have no 3D-support and also mplayer when playing movies shows it only in full screen mode and refuses to show it in its window.

It seems to me that Xserver does not operate fully somehow with the external screen - sending most of its capabilities to the internal screen (that is off always) and not to the external one. This my guess also proves the KDE 3.6 control center - in section of display it show only single screen w abilities of the laptop screen and it is no possibility to change the screen1 to another screen - that is KDE does not know on which screen it runs.

Also I can not use option "DRI" in Section "Device" - Xserver does not start then.

$ glxgears
X Error of failed request:  BadValue (integer parameter out of range for operation)
  Major opcode of failed request:  143 (GLX)
  Minor opcode of failed request:  19 (X_GLXQueryServerString)
  Value in failed request:  0x1
  Serial number of failed request:  17
  Current serial number in output stream:  17

In case it is informative. 

Therefore, if my guess i true, how I can totally move Xserver capabilities to be applied to the external monitor? If i'm wrong, then what's else could be the problem and I can settle it?

For instance, I use the monitor using only Xserver config file (that is w/o xrandr help).
