This behavior is usually due to working in "off line" mode.  Remember waaay
back in the dialup days?  People would download mail via POP, then reply to
all the emails with the results going into the 'outbox', hit 'send', and the
client would dial out and send all the queued emails back-to-back.

If you look at the xfs mailing list, most devs submit their patches in this
queued manner.  You'll see 10 or more emails all from the same dev with
timestamps only a few seconds apart.

Given all of the other things we know about cosme's situation, I think this
"dial up" sending behavior is the likely cause of what you describe.
There's nothing odd or sinister about it.  I don't care for this whole cosme
situation as it distracts the list.  I wish he'd go away.  That said, again,
there's nothing suspicious about his quick succession sending.
