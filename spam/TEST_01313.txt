I decided to follow Piotr's example and switched to Xfwm (I first
tried to completely switch to Xfce, but seriously=E2=80=A6panels meeting in=
 a
corner overlap each other?!) and after some fiddling I'm now happy
with it =E2=80=93 it behaves nearly exactly the same way Metacity used to
behave and I have the bell. The only thing I miss is the
Glider-theme :/

Best regards and thank you again,
