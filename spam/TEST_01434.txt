It does not require you to be C specialist to sync simple patches.  The
"patch" works in very simplistic principle so it can fail easily since
it is designed to be so.  We do not want false patch action.

You need to see original 2.6.33 and 2.6.32 sources; and patched 2.6.33 source.

@@ -71,9 +71,10 @@ means you look for line 71 (in 2.6.33).  While
looking in 2.6.32 line 68:
----------------
        /* dynamic controls, init_verbs and input_mux */
        struct auto_pin_cfg autocfg;
        struct snd_array kctls;
        struct hda_input_mux private_imux;
        hda_nid_t private_dac_nids[AUTO_CFG_MAX_OUTS];

        unsigned int jack_present :1;
        unsigned int inv_jack_detect:1;

#ifdef CONFIG_SND_HDA_POWER_SAVE
        struct hda_loopback_check loopback;
#endif
        /* for virtual master */
        hda_nid_t vmaster_nid;
        const char **slave_vols;
        const char **slave_sws;

-------------
Patch was:
-------------
-       unsigned int jack_present :1;
-       unsigned int inv_jack_detect:1; /* inverted jack-detection */
-       unsigned int inv_eapd:1;        /* inverted EAPD implementation */
+       unsigned int jack_present: 1;
+       unsigned int inv_jack_detect: 1;/* inverted jack-detection */
+       unsigned int inv_eapd: 1;       /* inverted EAPD implementation */
+       unsigned int analog_beep: 1;    /* analog beep input present */
-------------

I see I do not have "unsigned int inv_eapd:1;" thus patch fails to find
matching position.  ....  I see.  So there have been new EAPD support in
2.6.33.  This patch for "analog beep" is another extra over this.


I short, I will likely to replace this file with patched 2.6.33 one.
The diff, if you care to report to BTS after success, is this file vs.
original 2.6.32 file.

If this does not work, drop inv_eapd related ones and try.  Good luck.
