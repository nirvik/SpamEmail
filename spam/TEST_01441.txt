Teresa's written a wonderful blog post about the revelation that Tyco's crooked 
CEO spent "6,000 on a shower curtain, $15,000 for an umbrella stand, $2,900 on 
coat hangers, $5,960 on bedsheets and $2,200 for a wastebasket." 

    Naturally, they assured her that not only is it possible to pay $6,000 for 
    your shower curtains and $2,200 for a wastebasket, it's a Good Thing to do 
    so, practically essential. Then they explain how: 

    "Sometimes the wastebasket is exposed," said Joel Joves, a designer with 
    offices in Rancho Santa Fe and Beverly Hills. "If you have a fabulous study 
    or master bedroom, then maybe we need a pewter-finished basket with 
    decorative pearl beadings or semiprecious stones to complete the look of a 
    room." 

    That's Fool Money at work. If you can't find a sufficiently fabulous 
    wastebasket for $200, $500 absolute tops, you're not half trying.
