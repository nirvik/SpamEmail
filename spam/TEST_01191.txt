RE: [ILUG] mirroring on a running systemI don't see why not John, but I'd sure backup my data first ;--)

So I suppose you could setup half of the raid1, copy your partitions across,
vi lilo to append the new device labels, /dev/md0 instead of /dev/hda...
re-run lilo, then raidhotadd /dev/xxx /dev/md0 [or is that the other way
around?]

I have never tried this so this could be bollix, I have setup root-raid
systems but during install time, I have had drive failures on my
"production" systems at home and successfully re-built the raid many times.
IMHO linux software raid is extremely good.

When are we going to have a pint?

--------------------------
 I've a running system, and I want to set it up so that the disks are
mirrored. I'll win a little more read speed, and a lot more reliability.

 However, the RAID_HOWTO just mentions RAID 1 and RAID 0 on a machine
that's new. They don't mention anything about an existing setup. Is it
possible to setup disk mirroring on a running box ?
