Updated clamav versionHi,
debian-volatile team

I upgraded with aptitude on 02.04.10 for my 'squeeze'.
then try for dist-upgrade and found, ( as unable to upgrade clamav)
The following packages have unmet dependencies:
  libclamav6: Depends: libltdl3 (>= 1.5.2-2) which is a virtual package.
and with no solution.
I have in my source.list as,
deb http://volatile.debian.org/debian-volatile lenny/volatile main
contrib non-free.
I have now clamav-0.95.3+dfsg-1 and had no problem with updation.
Can we use upgraded clamav in future?

regards,
