Re: [IIU] Recommendations on phone / pda+phone + European GPRS coverage info.Hi,

I believe you get more value for money by separating the mobile phone from 
the PDA.

As expressed by power users on Open, a combination like a EUR 160 Nokia 
6310i talking to a EUR 440 Palm m515 will meet your specification. By using 
a EUR 90 Bluetooth SD chip, the Palm and the Nokia 6310i can talk to one 
another even when not in line of sight.

regards
Bernie
