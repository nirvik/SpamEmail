Virtuoso 6.1.1+dfsg1-1 breaks Nepomuk
I noticed that Nepomuk has stopped working for me, the reason presumably 
being that the virtuoso-t process is no longer running. I restarted the 
session, still virtuoso-t does not run, however, I see that files in

/.kde/share/apps/nepomuk/repository/main/data/virtuosobackend

have been touched.

As the virtuoso packages in unstable have been upgraded recently, I 
gather that something in there isn't working with Nepomuk anymore.
