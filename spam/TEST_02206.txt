The best answer I can think of is "so that you don't get financially
abused by the people who do know how to do it".  

Whenever kids ask why they need to learn math, I tell them "at the very
least, you need to know that the person behind the counter at McDonald's
is giving you the correct change".  

Learning something doesn't mean you have to be an expert, or that you have to 
do it all the time.  But knowledge is power, and it seems silly to
actively avoid knowledge, as so many people seem to do.  (By the way,
Lisi, this is not directed at your granddaughter -- your post just got me
thinking...)
