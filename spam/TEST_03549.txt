Re: [ILUG] Architecture crossover trouble w RH7.2 (solved)On Fri, Jul 26, 2002 at 03:56:22PM +0100 or so it is rumoured hereabouts, 
Wynne, Conor thought:

Yeah, but then I'd have to remember _exactly_ which confs I'd modified and
they're not all in /etc either...

Yup...  In this case, I had two issues.  1. I mirrored the disk to give to
someone else to work on but the box he has available has only a P1 or P2
processor.  2. My celeron box has been crashing the backup software so I
wanted to try out the backup in a different box to make sure it's hardware
related.  Again, it's also an interesting exercise...

Oh, I'm doing that too.  This is going to Africa so I'm aiming for as
robust as possible with belt, braces and probably an all-in-one jumpsuit!
I'll be mirroring the disk but that is worth only so much (eg. lightning
strike taking out the disk(s) or system compromise)  I'm also going for a
backup to CDR with an automated restore http://www.mondorescue.org .  The
admin out there wouldn't be able to build the system again if the mobo got
fried and the replacement was the wrong arch but an i386 compatible
install will mean just dropping in the HD and booting (ish)...
