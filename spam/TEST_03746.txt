evolution 2.30 with exchangehi,
I tested evolution 2.30 in sid to access my exchange mailbox, something
that's working painfully in lenny. In sid evolution says that network is
not available. Why? 

Do you know if  it is working at all? there seem to be many bugs in this
version. Any experience with exchange mails?

regards
