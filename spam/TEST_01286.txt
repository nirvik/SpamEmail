I did not ask you for help, the message was for other person, and it
was a comment; then you are not helping; you are an intruder, and a
troll, of course.

Do you ask for "orders"? this is one, your speech is well known at
wrongly named "developed countries", where people eat people, and many
like you used to use the peace flag to create wars!

You can see it again, more orders, because i did not ask for your
help, and one easily can distinguish that your speech is absolutely
untruthful and obscure; it is not a plain language. Classic capitalist
language, where you can not be sane. Where you are sorry if you do not
have power in your hands, specialy if you are from an oldest lineage.
It is enough to see how you mix post to appear as a suffered helper,
come on "be a man". Accept that you are insane!

Again, why do you think that you have the right to help me, if i did
not ask for help? it could be better if you say the true, you want to
look as an important person in the world, that is all.
