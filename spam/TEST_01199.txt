flavor cystalsCan anyone stop talking politics long enough to let me know that,
yes, indeed, they do remember the Suburban Lawns?

Better yet, tell me where I should be listening for new music now that
P2P is dead and I still can't pick up KFJC very well.

-- 
Give me time I will be clear; given time you'll understand.
What possesses me to right what you have suffered.
I'm in this mood because of scorn; I'm in a mood for total war.
To the darkened skies once more and ever onward.
