 Well, this mostly worked, despite Colm saying that "you want the
"failed-disk" *instead* of the second "raid-disk", not in addition to it".

 I suppose that means instead of:

> raiddev /dev/md0
>         raid-level      1
>         nr-raid-disks   2
>         nr-spare-disks  0
>         chunk-size     4
>         persistent-superblock 1
>         device          /dev/hdg3
>         raid-disk       0
>         device          /dev/hda5
>         raid-disk       1
> 
>         failed-disk     1

 I should have had:

> raiddev /dev/md0
>         raid-level      1
>         nr-raid-disks   2
>         nr-spare-disks  0
>         chunk-size     4
>         persistent-superblock 1
>         device          /dev/hdg3
>         raid-disk       0
>         device          /dev/hda5
>         failed-disk     1

 It likely means that I was just lucky I put the failed-disk directive
after the raid-disk one :)

 Anyway. It's doesn't quite boot right, with /=/dev/md0 in fstab. On boot, I see:

 Any ideas why ?

 My suspicion is that I've a lack of knowledge about how initrd works, so
I'm not sure it's loading it. For a start, the / filesystem is being
mounted as ext2, at first, not ext3. It does seem mounted as ext3 after
the fsck is done - but that means that it's mounted as ext2 read only,
fsck'ed and then remounted ext3. Losing the point of it.

 Given I can't pass the kernel parameters (I think), how then can I get it
to load the initrd ?
