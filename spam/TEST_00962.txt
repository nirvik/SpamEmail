Re: Encryption approach to secure web applicationsHi,

Thank you for the useful replies, I have found some interesting 
tutorials in the ibm developer connection.

https://www6.software.ibm.com/developerworks/education/j-sec1

and

https://www6.software.ibm.com/developerworks/education/j-sec2

Registration is needed.

I will post the same message on the Web Application Security list, as 
suggested by someone.

For now, I thing I will use md5 for password checking (I will use the 
approach described in secure programmin fo linux and unix how-to).

I will separate the authentication module, so I can change its 
implementation at anytime.

Thank you again!
