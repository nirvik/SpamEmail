You used to boot from SystemRescueCD and backup the partitions
corresponding to the (unmounted) filesystems block by block? Or you
mounted them and backed up the (mounted) filesystems?

You can continue to do either of these that even though you've got RAID1
and LVM. Start up RAID1 and LVM, and then back up the logical partitions
(or filesystems) that result. Ignore the physical ones.

TBH I'm not aware of any backup feature within SystemRescueCD, but there
are many useful tools there. I've successfully fixed up software RAID1
configurations, and it must work with LVM because most of my systems'
filesystems are based on RAID1/LVM combinations and it works for me.

Without the bs argument you would have been reading the disk 512bytes
at a time. Try bs=1000k for better throughput.

How do you know any of your backups work? Test them!

LVM provides a snapshot mode for this kind of requirement. It's not
stunning but it's usually sufficient.
