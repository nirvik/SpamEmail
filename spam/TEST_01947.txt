Then again, perhaps the particular font I'm using just has bad
bytecodes.  That font is "QuickType II", grabbed off my Windows
partition, where it was installed by I-have-no-idea-which-application.

Anybody else experimenting with bytecode-enabled freetype, presumably
with different fonts?  Do you find the same bad antialiased rendering
that I found, or do other fonts work well?
