Libertarianism is implemented in North America? Where?!?!?

Telecom regulations are an example of implemented Libertarianism?

And for how screwed up North America's telecom industries and
regulators are, they're better than much of the rest of the
world, where it doesn't just "take a year or more" to get
started: it's impossible/illegal. 

Matters of degree, matter.

We can lose billions of dollars, and have hundreds of thousands of 
people laid off... and after it all, our diets, health, longevity, 
and freedom to pursue activities of our own choosing are still the 
envy of billions of people. 

Would you rather be unemployed, broke, and in possession of career
skills which merely match the local average in:

  - North America, or 
  - India/Peru/Egypt/Philippines/etc
