Not missing as such, but there is one thing which annoys me to no end:

On a Phenom X2 with 4 GiB RAM and a pretty new GFX card whose name
I don't remember, I get random hangs while doing nothing more than light
surfing with some minimal background activity.
KDE 3.5.10 (almost) never has this issue. I know because I still use KDE
3.5.10 at work and even though the hardware is _years_ older, it's a _lot_
faster.
And yes, I have Nepomuk off, no fancy effects, no nothing.
Unfortunately, this is nothing you can file a bug against.

Of course, computers become faster all the time and so the issue will
somewhat solve itself over time, but still.


The rest which annoys me can be found in the bug tracker.

PS: With 4.4, I migrated my gf to KDE 4. With 4.5, I might even start
using unstable, and not lenny, at work again.
