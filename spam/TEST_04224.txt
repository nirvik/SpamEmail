Please mention the gist of what someone is saying rather than expect 
people to bring up the link in their $BROWSER. The subject you provided 
looked too much like spam (even though it reflected the linked article).

reportbug doesn't help you re-open a bug (bug #157283 from 2002 [1]) or 
mark a bug as forwarded upstream (bug #579201 just reported by me [2]). 
It is very good on providing version information of the package and its 
dependencies but is let down by those omissions.

For anyone's information, the guide at
http://www.debian.org/Bugs/server-control
provides information on marking a bug as reported upstream, re-opening a 
bug report, and many more developer-oriented options.

There is more to it than that. Be constructive in bug reporting and 
don't be afraid to ask for help in how to isolate the problem. If you're 
prepared to ask how to perform a git-bisect of the kernel (for a kernel 
problem that causes a reproducible error) or run the program under gdb
or its debug options to catch error behaviour, you can help solve a 
problem with the kernel/program.

Even if you only report a difficult to reproduce problem with report, 
the fact that the problem exists is made available to the package 
maintainer and other users with at least the version of the package and 
its dependencies included.
