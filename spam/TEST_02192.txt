how's about the String Joke?

A piece of string and his friend walks into a bar.  The barman says
"sorry, we don't serve string here".  String & friend walk out
(grumbling).  String asks friend "listen, could you tatter my ends and
tie me up?"  Friend obliges, and they return; barman says "aren't you
that piece of string I threw out?"  "No, I'm a frayed knot."
