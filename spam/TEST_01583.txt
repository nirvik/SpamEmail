~/.xsession-errors file grows way too bigHi,

I am astonished to find out that my ~/.xsession-errors grows to a 
humongous 640M! My wife's is nearly 400M as well. This is way way too 
big. 

I took a look, the reason and cure is very simple -- having X to trunk it 
each time when started 
(http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=287876)
whereas currently, my ~/.xsession-errors kept logs back to stone age. 

However, such reasonable request has been tabled for 6 years now. The DD 
gave loads of irrelevant reasons as excuse of not fixing it. Ref:
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=276545

Any comment?
