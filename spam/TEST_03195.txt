No, definitely not normal. And it's even weirder the behaviour you are 
describing here because once the video has been fully buffered, it should 
reproduce smoothly, with no glitches nor pauses and no at double-triple 
speed, of course :-)

Have you try to clean Icewasel's cache? History, temporary and cookie 
files... they tend to increase their size very easily.
