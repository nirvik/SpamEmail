Checking the wiki page again, it says,

"If the motherboard has two pairs of differently colored DIMM sockets 
(the colors indicate which bank they belong to, bank 0 or bank 1), then 
one can place a matched pair of memory modules in bank 0, but a 
different-capacity pair of modules in bank 1, as long as they are of the 
same speed."

Which says to me that if I have a board with 4 memory slots of which 2 
are colored light-blue and 2 are colored black and 2 1GB modules of 
identical speed, then I place both modules in either the light-blue 
slots of the black slots.
