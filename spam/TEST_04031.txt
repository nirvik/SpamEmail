Quod erat not demonstrandum at all.

There are massive amounts of libraries for C, Fortran and so on.
To pick an obvious example., if you want to do linear algebra, then
Java isn't a serious candidate at all.

Furthermore, plenty of bugs occur in the libraries too, at a lower
rate due to more users having been bitten by them, but they are much
harder for you to fix than in your own code.

Why do so many people outside of Sun's marketing department consider
Java to be "Write Once, Debug Everywhere" ?
