Both "locale" and "ldconfig" were shifted from libc6 to libc-bin going
from Lenny and Squeeze; my guess would be that you upgraded to the
Squeeze version of libc6, but you did not yet complete the installation
of libc-bin, so now these important commands (and others) are missing on
your system. (The libc-bin package does not exist for Lenny.)

If dpkg still works then you can try to download libc-bin for your
architecture from http://packages.debian.org/squeeze/libc-bin and
install the .deb with "dpkg -i ...", see here:
