ATX means you'll get lots of built-in features.  I like my Gigabyte 
GA-MA780G-UD3H mobo with AM2+/AM2 socket.

8GM RAM, 6 SATA, 1 (or 2, I forget) rear eSATA, lots of USB, a front 
and rear Firewire and decent on-board audio.  On-board ATI video 
with separate video RAM, but I installed a fanless NVIDIA card 
because the driver situation is *simple*, and it's fast.
