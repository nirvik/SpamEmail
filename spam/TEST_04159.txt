Im using kde 4.4.3 and I rather like it. However there is a fork of KDE 
3.5.x http://trinity.pearsoncomputing.net/
You could compile the packages yourself. Yes before i get flamed for it 
i know its ubuntu but however the code it freely accessible from the kde 
trunk so it would not be all that hard to compile it.
