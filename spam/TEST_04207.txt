Re: [Razor-users] Using razor with maildrop
Here is my recipe for Maildrop:

# Vipul's Razor check
#
log `/usr/bin/razor-check`
log "razor-check = $RETURNCODE"
if ( $RETURNCODE == 0 )
{
  xfilter "reformail -a'X-Razor: SPAM'"
  log "SPAM caught by Vipul's Razor"
  to "$FOLDERS/.SPAM/"
}

I used this with Razor version 1.  I'm not sure if it was ever used
with Razor2.  I am now using SpamAssassin w/ Razor2.  You may wish to
remove the log statements once running.

I use both.  SpamAssassin (SA) catches things that Razor does not.  There
were enough false positives with Razor that I do not trust it alone.
After whitelisting all the newsletters I receive, SA w/ Razor2 does a
very good job.

HTH,
