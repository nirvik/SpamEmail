It seems like ATTWS will offer a service that'll tell you where your friends 
(or children or spouse or whatever) are ... I haven't seen it announced, but 
from their "Explanation of Rates and Charges. "Find Friends service will only 
locate a compatible mobile device with mMode service that (1) has granted you 
permission, (2) is turned on, (3) is registered on the AT&T Wireless GSM/GPRS 
network, and (4) has not activated Be Invisible. Location services only provide 
the location...
