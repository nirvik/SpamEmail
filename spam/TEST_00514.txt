ssh-agent terminates before session endsHi,

after upgrading to the experimental packages of KDE ssh-agent 
seems to terminate shortly after logging in. I'm able to enter 
my passphrase with ssh-add and I'm able to log into another 
machine but after a few minutes the agent terminates.

ssh-agent is started during kdm login via "use-ssh-agent" in 
/etc/X11/Xsession.options. This worked before without any 
problems. Does anyone else encounter the same problem?

regards,
JÃ¶rg
