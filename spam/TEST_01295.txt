Eduardo is correct.  IBM mainframes do use EBCDIC.  They always have.
They always will.  (Changing to ASCII now would break EVERYTHING.)
I am a systems programmer for IBM mainframes, and have been for the
last umpteen years; so I speak from personal experience.  And yes,
modern mainframe operating systems do have a POSIX interface.
z/OS (MVS) calls it "Unix System Services".  z/VM calls it
"OpenExtensions".  It is a Unix-like interface, but it uses EBCDIC
internally.

You can also run GNU/Linux on a mainframe, either directly in an LPAR
or in a virtual machine under z/VM.  But GNU/Linux is an ASCII-based
operating system, even when running on a mainframe.  Linux device
drivers for the s390 architecture talk EBCDIC when necessary to
communicate with EBCDIC devices (such as I/O to the 3215 virtual console
under z/VM or reading the disk labels of OS- or CMS-formatted disks),
but as observed by an application program running under Linux on
the s390 architecture, it is running in a pure ASCII environment.
