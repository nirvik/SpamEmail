They had it up and running in a couple of weeks.  A couple of weeks to me
would seem to say they didn't have to modify a ton of code.  Or, maybe
they're just really efficient programmers.  The truth probably lies
somewhere in between.

I made no such statements about the "guts" being the same or similar.  I
simply stated that because both the Linux kernel and XFS were written in C
that the XFS code changes were probably fairly minor.  They didn't rewrite
it from the ground up.  I've never found any documentation that details the
changes and I don't have access to the original IRIX 6.5.x source code so I
can't do a diff on the XFS code.  I can only guess.  And knowing what I do,
I'm guessing I'm probably close to being on the money.

You are correct.  IRIX predates XFS by half a decade.  IRIX was developed
and released on the 32bit MIPS CPUs, the 2xxx and 3xxx series.

And that's the only point I was making about the 32bit x86 work.  Even if
XFS wasn't originally developed on MIPS64 in 1992/93, the XFS code base in
2001 was fully 64 bit and had been for many many years.  Porting IRIX from
64bit MIPS to 64bit Itanium and other 64bit arches such as Alpha was far
less of an effort than "down" porting it to 32bit x86, which came some years
later, IIRC.  Such a project requires changing a ton of data structures from
8 bytes wide to 4 bytes wide.  The down port to 32bit x86 and the porting to
other architectures was, TTBOMK, required to get XFS into the mainline kernel.
