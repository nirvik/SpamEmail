What prevents mounting of USB devices?-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

I run KDE and normally mount usb devices with the "Storage Media" applet
in the task bar. Recently I have been getting strange errors and
mounting failed:


Rejected send message, 3 matched rules; type="method_call",
sender=":1.21" (uid=101 pid=13921 comm="kded [kdeinit] --new-startup ")
interface="org.freedesktop.Hal.Device.Volume" member="Mount" error
name="(unset)" requested_reply=0 destination="org.freedesktop.Hal"
(uid=0 pid=11879 comm="/usr/sbin/hald "))	


Mounting as root on the commandline still works, but it's a hassle for
the user who wants to simple use their usb stick.

And the UUID of the usb stick is even listed in /etc/fstab so that it is
supposed to mount automatically when plugged in (though that does not
seem to work). But that may be an unrelated issue.

Another (possibly also unrelated) issue is that when several X are
running (different users, all with KDE) then it seems that only one of
them can mount and unmount, usually the wrong user.

Is it worth digging into hal to correct this? Given that hal won't be in
Debian much longer.
