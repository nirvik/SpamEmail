USB device attached via RS232 adaptorA neighbor with an old Debian (probably etch but could be sarge)
machine needs to know where a USB smart card reader attached via RS232
adaptor would be found in the filesystem. He went through /dev, with
special attention on the tty* entries, but did not find it. What is
the right way to find the device so that he could mount it?

Thanks.
