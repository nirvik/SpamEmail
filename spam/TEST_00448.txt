Run clamav lenny packages on etch?Hello,

is it possible to run the clamav-packages for lenny from the volatile
repository on Debian etch?
Some machines still run etch here and the latest version installed is
0.95.3... :-/

I was curious an changed my sources.list from

# ClamAV Update
deb http://volatile.debian.org/debian-volatile etch/volatile main
contrib non-free

into

# ClamAV Update
deb http://volatile.debian.org/debian-volatile lenny/volatile main
contrib non-free

and did

apt-get update
apt-get -s dist-update

The system shows me clamav-base and clamav-testfiles to be updated
without any complain about missing dependencies...

Thanks!

Regards,
Ivan
