I do not understand what you mean here. I use Sid and I am not aware of
any recent problems with either hal or udev. (I stress this to warn you
that I might be unaware of some fundamental aspects of your issue.)

I would start by checking:

1) Does hal know that there is a touchpad?

   lshal -u $(hal-find-by-capability --capability input.touchpad)

2) The output of 1) should tell you the associated linux.device_file; in
   my case this is /dev/input/event7. The next step is to find the
   devpath:

   udevadm info --query=path --name=/dev/input/event7

3) I get "/devices/platform/i8042/serio4/input/input7/event7" from 2).
   Now one can test what udev does when the device is added; maybe that
   command will give you a clue, or you can make the output available so
   that we can compare:

   udevadm test /devices/platform/i8042/serio4/input/input7/event7
