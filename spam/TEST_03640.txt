As an aside: one of the best ways to dodge SpamAssassin is by having an
In-Reply-To header.  Most list traffic should meet this criterion.

Alternately, I can whitelist mail to spambayes@python.org -- that'll
work until spammers get ahold of the list address, which usually seems
to take a few months.
