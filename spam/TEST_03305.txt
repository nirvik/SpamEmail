As a user of one of the non-x86-derivative architectures (s390) I am
grateful for this rule.  This rule is often the only thing that motivates
package maintainers to fix the problem on my architecture.  Many package
maintainers seem to have the attitude of "Who cares that it doesn't build
on s390?  Nobody uses s390 anyway."  But some people do, such as yours
truly.  And I care.  And that rule forces the package maintainer to fix
the build problem on s390.  I am also subscribed to the debian-s390 list,
and the package maintainers sometimes post on that list saying, in effect,
"how can I fix this build problem?"  And sometimes, I've been able to
help them.
