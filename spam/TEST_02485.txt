> Greetings!  I'm new to this list, and new to Razor.  Trying to get it to
compile now (perhaps more on that later), but I'm wondering if it can really
do what I need anyway.  In short my question is whether Razor can process
files directly from sendmail's queues.  Here's the situation.

You can use a milter with sendmail that will add an X-header labeling the
mail as spam for procmail processing later (see smrazor:
http://www.sapros.com/smrazor/ ). You can modify the .c file to reject the
email instead. I have been using this with sendmail 8.12.5 and Solaris 9
with razor-agents 2.14 quite successfully (barring network/catalogue server
issues) ...
