RE: [Razor-users] What's wrong with the Razor servers now?If I specify -rs on razor-check and point to honor then it checks fine.
Also if I point to apt to report then I get an authentication error so
is there something wrong with that box?

I'm still seeing this.  It reports to honor.cloudmark.com but checks
against apt.cloudmark.com.  What is the sync delay between these boxes?

I noticed a low count of razor'd spam messages. So after digging, if I
razor-report a message the diags say that it was accepted but if I turn
around and run a check on the exact same message that was reported, then
it doesn't find the sig and as such isn't spam.
