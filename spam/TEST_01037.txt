The two problems I see with filtering that early are:

    1. Everyone receiving email via that server will contribute ham to the
       stew, making the Bayesian classification less effective.

    2. Given that there will be some false positives, you absolutely have to
       put the mail somewhere.  You can't simply delete it.  (I also don't
       like the TMDA-ish business of replying with a msg that says, "here's
       what you do to really get your message to me."  That puts an extra
       burden on my correspondents.)  As an individual, I would prefer you
       put spammish messages somewhere where I can review them, not an
       anonymous sysadmin who I might not trust with my personal email
       (nothing against you Greg ;-).

I personally prefer to manage this stuff at the user agent level.  Bandwidth
is a heck of a lot cheaper than my time.
