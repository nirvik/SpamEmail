Not the same monitor (LG FLATRON W2042S) but have had no success in
finding anything to auto-switch the 4:3 modes correctly.  My assumption
being that, because there's a button to do the job, it's not possible to
do it in software as the relevant commands don't exist to do it.

If you don't run the monitor at its native resolution, things can look
pretty ugly anyway.

Now, there's an oxymoron for you.   :-)
