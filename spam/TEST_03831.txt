AUGD: Re: Free Ride for Board Members?> So I'm curious to hear opinions on the notion of MUG board members =
being free from paying group dues, as a thanks for the time they give, =
as well as a potential means of attracting new board members -- =
something we are having a very hard time with.

Although it can be hard to get people to be board members, I don't think =
giving a board member free group dues would make any difference. Our =
group dues are $25, not enough to entice someone to do the 'footwork'.   =
