The tooth fairy?

There were never millions of natives in Florida (until recently :).

Cortez never went to Florida, AFAIK.  Ponce de Leon discovered it.
The Indian peoples he found there stuck around until a bunch of them
moved to Cuba with the Spanish when a bunch of Seminole Indians
invaded from the North with the English, in the seventeenth century.
The remainder merged in with the new population, or died, or whatever,
and their culture disappeared.
