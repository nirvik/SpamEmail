So you changed "Verbosity 4" and "LogVerbosity 4" but still nothing in "/
var/log/hibernate.log"? Strange... as soon as the system is called to 
hibernate, it should start filling that file.

BTW, how do you call the hibernation state? You should type "hibernation" 
in a text console (gnome-terminal, xterm, konsole...).

Ok, let's try another approach (I think you mentioned this in your first 
post). In "common.conf" comment-out "UnloadModules" line and specify the 
exact module name you want to be unloaded:

***
UnloadModules uvcvideo
***

But we still are facing two problems here:

1/ No log -> no way to know if the module has been successfully unloaded.

2/ "UnloadBlacklistedModules yes" should perform the requested action as 
the last module listed in the blacklisted file (blacklisted-modules) is 
indeed "uvcvideo" and applies to any kernel version.
