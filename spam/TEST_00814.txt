If we had more variety of franchise food than the
Wendys/KFC/PizzaHut/TacoBell/TimHorton's monopoly (they are all Pepsi
under the hood, aren't they?), things might be different.  When a New
Yorker has biscotti, we have a timbit, when a Parisienne has a
croissant, we have a timbit ... because that's all we can buy.

The USA is a nation founded on creative free enterprise entrepreneurs;
Canada is a nation built on monopolies.
