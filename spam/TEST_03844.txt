IMHO when a config setting is not handled properly on upgrade of KDE its a=
=20
bug.

I migrated configuration from KDE 3.5.10 and just pressed on "Reset to=20
defaults" for quite some appearance related settings in order to switch=20
them to Oxygen. There have been issues, but I mostly didn't file them as=20
bugs.

Only one I triaged and filed: The separator "58" for colon for web=20
shortcuts in kuriikwsrc or something like that it was is not recognized by=
=20
KRunner, only by Konqueror. ":" instead works with both. Unfortunately=20
Konqueror saved it as "58" not as ":".

Anyway I suggest to file those issues as concrete as possible as bugs as=20
you manage to take time for it.
