Not so fast! :) How are you supposed to

what they will be labelled as?

The map files specify what the mount point names will be.  If you added the lines to the map files then you should know what the mount points are.  Additionally, if you set it up so that all the mount points are under 
/mnt then you could put soft links in, say, /media pointing to where the actual mount points will be.  Then you can access the link in /media 
and the device will be automatically mounted and accessed.  This also 
has the advantage of allowing the link to be visible to GUI file 
managers to allow access that way.  Scratch that last sentence.  I had 
seen that as a suggestion, but had not tried it myself.  I just did try 
it, using PCManFM and it did not work.  PCManFM sees the link, but does 
not know what to do with it.  The soft link would still help with 
command line access, however.
