belocs-locales-bin brokenI put through a pile of updates on many Lenny systems this morning and
they all errored with:

  az_AZ.UTF-8... up-to-date
  be_BY.UTF-8... up-to-date
  be_BY.UTF-8@latin... up-to-date
  ber_DZ.UTF-8... cannot open locale definition file `ber_DZ': No such
file or directory
dpkg: error processing belocs-locales-bin (--configure):
 subprocess post-installation script returned error exit status 4
Errors were encountered while processing:
 belocs-locales-bin
E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)

Is something broken in the belocs-locales-bin package? Thanks - John
