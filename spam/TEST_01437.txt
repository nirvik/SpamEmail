Nice to hear that I'm not the only one with this "ancient" configuration. For 
me 4.4.3 made things much worse, and no Eclipse included.

Not sure if only the new presence of virtuoso and akonadi take away the 
remaining free ram now triggering swapping. Strigi is off, of course and I 
wonder if any other tricks might make KDE agreeable again in speed.
