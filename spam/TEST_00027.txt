It seems reasonable to have a configurable minimum below which
spamassassin flattens the test to zero (turning it off): by default set
to zero; but if you set it to say 0.01, spamassassin would ignore tests
with scores -0.01<0<0.01 (trading accuracy for time).

The overkill variant of this feature would have scores scored by (score
* relative-time-taken) with relative-time-taken computed over a large
corpus (probably Craig's ;} ). Then you could specify a minimum value of
*that* parameter to flatten at, giving assurances that you're killing
only tests that are expensive for their utility.

Unfortunately I can't think of a good name for that parameter.

I can whip up a patch if anyone thinks this is any use.
