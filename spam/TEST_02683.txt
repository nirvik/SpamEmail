Semantics can be pushed from above or below. If you want semantics,
any place to start is better than no place to start. And no one can just
keep your own personal information from you when you save it locally.

That, or the times were not ready back then. Personally, I am not

True. And it kept on silently infuriating me as well. But filing bugs

ashamed for using, and defending, KDE 4 any more.
