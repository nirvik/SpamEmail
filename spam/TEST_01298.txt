Hi!

Just as a warning cause I lost a mail I took over one hour to write. I=20
copied it to kwrite to preserve the mail text without the hard linefeeds=20
that KMail usually added when sending the mail. On trying to hover on save=
=20
menu entry I also hovered on recent files =3D> kaboom and mail lost.

While I think its a DRI issue I also reported it with Debian and KDE, as I=
=20
think Debian should block on it and KDE project should be aware of the=20
issue as well

No bug number for Debian yet known to me.

Ciao,
