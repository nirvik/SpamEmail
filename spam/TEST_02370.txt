Can't switch to DASHIf  this is a repeat I apologize for the noise.


With this mornings upgrade to testing there was a new
version of DASH.
I've been using BASH..and tried to switch.


frank@squeeze:~$ sudo dpkg-reconfigure dash
dpkg-divert: mismatch on package
  when removing `diversion of /bin/sh by dash'
  found `diversion of /bin/sh to /bin/sh.distrib by bash'

Is this a bug or am I missing something?

Thanks
