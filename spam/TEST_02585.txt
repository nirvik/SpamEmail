OK... there are also some warnings:

'QTCaptureSession' may not respond to '-setDelegate:'
'QTCaptureSession' may not respond to '-setEnabled:'

'QTCaptureVideoPreviewOutput' may not respond to '-connectedChannels'
'QTCaptureVideoPreviewOutput' may not respond to =
'-setVisualContext:forChannel:'

It does mix two movies now, it just doesn't see my computer's camera.
