public mailing list sign up packageHas anyone seen/heard of/used some package that would let a random person 
go to a webpage, create a mailing list, then administer that list.  Also 
of course let ppl sign up for the lists and manage their subscriptions. 
Similar to the old listbot.org, but i'd like to have it running on my 
server not someone elses :)
