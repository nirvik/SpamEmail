Re: Bluetooth-dev Digest, Vol 7, Issue 13Hello,

Thank you everybody for your input so far. Digging into this code has given me a chance to clean up some ugliness :-) But I keep hitting roadblocks where I really need to interact with the hardware in a nice procedural way. The synchronous behavior of bluetooth requires two-thread synchronization to achieve this. That code works great assuming I have a dedicated bluetooth thread!

Apple stating that two core services, UI and Bluetooth, should exist in and share the runloop in main is terrible.

I am reluctant to offload BT communications to an auxiliary process because of the non-modal user interactions with the IOBluetoothDeviceInquiry, IOBluetoothDevice, and IOBluetoothRFCOMMChannel. 

If anybody knows of sample code out there for creating an aux process that can manage those objects and expose the functions over some kind of IAC, I would love to see it.

And not knowing the internals of the bluetooth framework, I am thinking there has to be a thread-safe way to install and manage the bluetooth runloop input mechanism in a non-main thread. If anybody has any hints on that, that would be the simplest solution.

Cheers,
Dave
