Yeah, I figured that, but it doesn't seem to ... well, if that's the case
I'll give it another go tonight, maybe come back with some error messages.

Just to clarify for those who didn't understand me initially - I have a
floppy drive installed, but it doesn't physically work. There's nowhere
handy to pick one up where I am, and I don't fancy waiting a few days for
one to arrive from Peats.

Thanks for the answers,
Ciaran.
