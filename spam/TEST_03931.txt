How about something like:

cd {dest.dir}
tar -C {source.dir} cf - | tar xf -

tar cf - will pipe the tar file to stdout and tar xf - will untar it. This
should keep permissions and links, and if you do it as root you will keep
the owners too... :)

Not tested, though. You may need other flags as well.
