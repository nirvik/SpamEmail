Re: [Razor-users] What's wrong with the Razor servers now?Craig, 

For the most part, 99% times 99% users agree on what is spam. This is the
nature of the spam problem. Now if you were to use a "personal trust"
system, you'd have a huge personal trust group that would include 99% of
the userbase. This means 99% times you'd be coming to the same conclusion,
only after burning several orders of magnitude more CPU cycles. That would
be stupid. Also, it would take several orders of magnitude longer to
bootstrap and reach effectiveness. Sub-optimal in the extreme.

As regards to the problems with the "gray" areas you mentioned, servers
recognize such content, and razor-agents can use this information to make
individual determination. Not to mention, users can set a local confidence
level they are confortable with.

cheers,
vipul.
