Broken Debian's testing migration (grave bug in module-init-tools)There's something broken in the design of Debian's migration to testing.

A grave bug in the testing version of module-init-tools (3.12~pre2-1)
was fixed several weeks ago, and the package was uploaded with
urgency=high:

 module-init-tools  (3.12~pre2-2) unstable; urgency=high

   * Fixed an init scripts dependency loop introduced in -1. (Closes: #574535)

but it hasn't migrated to testing yet!

The reason is a build failure on HPPA:

  https://buildd.debian.org/build.php?arch=hppa&pkg=module-init-tools&ver=3.12~pre2-2

Isn't it unacceptable that a problem on some platform blocks a fix
for a grave bug?

Is there a risk that such a broken package gets into squeeze?
Due to this problem, this is the current candidate for squeeze:

  http://packages.debian.org/squeeze/module-init-tools

says: module-init-tools (3.12~pre2-1)

The grave bug is detected by apt-listbugs. Otherwise, as the bug was
fixed (in unstable), it isn't immediately visible on the various web
pages.
