I have now got to a point that I have a working MySQL database system on 
my localhost machine. I thought that I would not have any problem 
migrating this to my ISP appropriate MySQL space, but so far I have 
failed to do so. Local doc is very scarce, and I did not find any 
relevant FAQ. I did find the relevant paths though, and succeeded 
installing a short php script which displays the current date, using 
strftime(), but there is no way I can access databases. From the online 
doc, I learnt that I can't create databases, and that I can just create 
tables under the database that already exists. If I import a table, only 
its structure gets imported, not its content, and then an error message 
says that I don't have privileges for this... so I am surely missing 
something as far as setting up is concerned, or initialization. In my 
efforts to fetch info, I got a few hints, but they were negative ones, 
for instance someone kind of said that most ISP did not allow their 
customers to more than one authenticated user. This would mean that I 
could not expect to install a database that would be available to the 
members of a club, each of them having a login and password.

Could someone tell me where I could find relevant information and docs ? 
And maybe mention one or more ISP that would provide suitable mysql 
facilities ?
