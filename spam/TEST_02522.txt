How to set high-quality flag on DV movies in QTX?DV compressed movies often play fuzzy, as every other line is thrown  
out.
On QT Player Pro, you could set the High Quality flag to eliminate  
this, in Window>Show Movie Properties, Video Track, Visual Settings,  
check High Quality.
Then it was possible to also do it if you did not have QT Player Pro,  
by setting Preferences> Use high-quality  video setting when available.
It seems that in QuickTime Player 10 there does not seem to be any way  
to do this.
There was a free utility, HiQual
http://www.synthetic-ap.com/products/hiq/index.html
that could set the high quality flag, but it does not work in OSX 10.6
Anyone have any ideas how to set the high quality flag in Snow  
Leopard, for free, or to get DV encoded movies to play in high quality  
in QT 10?
(Assuming you don't have QT 7 Player Pro to set it)

Thanks,
