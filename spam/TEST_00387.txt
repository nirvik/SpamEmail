Postfix provides a binary called /usr/sbin/sendmail that does the right
thing. Which, presumably involves sticking your outgoing going message
in the right queue. Then you need your postfix SMTP client to
authenticate with your postfix SMTP server. Are you using SASL? If so,
I remember seeing documentation on how to configure the postfix SMTP
client to authenticate.
