Getting new media on is a bit out of the reach of the kindala. With a CD
solution you hand em a disc and in it goes.

Tradeoffs abound.

Heather got a CD player when she was 5. Even though it was a crappy
handmedown it worked great other than the batterys poping out..bad bad ui
there. Her next one was a store bought.  Its an all Audio player, no mp3
decoders for her yet. I wanted to do the bottom line Volt but momala put
the kabash on anything costing over 30 bucks. heck I had to scrounge ebay
to get her a palm m100 for about 25 bucks.

The only hitch is new music. Upshot is we spend time going over usenet
listing togther:)-

Its a happy family.

Now for Benjamin, yea id love to have something like the amazingly cool
Fisher Price My First (cd, casset, vasectomy, dirtybomb) products. Perhaps
the My First Cd might work...time to let ebay do the walking.
