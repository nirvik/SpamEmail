RE: Slaughter in the Name of GodWhat I understood was that the activists on the train refused to pay for
the food and other items they acquired from the Muslim vendors -- then
taunted them.

That may not be true, but it would put things in a more interesting
light.  Taking food from a small vendor in India and not paying them is
trying to starve them.

It sounded consistent with the ideas and purpose of the train full of
activists.

I'm rarely an apologist for Muslims anywhere.  Yet I find my sympathies
with the Muslims in this case, even after they burned the train.
