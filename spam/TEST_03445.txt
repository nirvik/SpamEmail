Yes, google (and all other search sites) quickly lead to d-m. But what
does this really prove? We all know that google (and all other search
sites) are far from immune against finding malware sites. Example:
google "windows multimedia". On the first page of results, half the hits
are sites with pretty dubious names. I wouldn't be surprised if some of
them actually distributed malware.

Linux is generally better protected against malware as Windows, but this
 is one vulnerability that is common to both: if you install anything
from an untrusted repo, and if that repo had malware, you're toast.

I understand that point of view. But it is a point of view that will
make people stay away from d-m (and pretty much all other repos for that
matter).

It would help a lot if the key of d-m (package
debian-multimedia-keyring) was in the debian repos, not just the d-m repos.
