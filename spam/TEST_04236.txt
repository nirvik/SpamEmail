You cannot condemn an actitute that is not being perceived by the user. 
And I don't think the OP knows what is he doing.

Yes, it is quoted, badly, but quoted. 

If you were a frequent user of the Spanish mailing list, you would have 
noticed that many of the posts are directed not to the list but to the 
users own e-mail address >:-)

I know him from the Spanish mailing list so, as he barely replies to the 
people who is giving some advice, I stopped from replying to his posts 
some time ago ;-)

Look, every time he posts to the Spanish mailing list, it duplicates the 
same message here. And note the *sending* time:

There is just an interval of *35 seconds* between one mail and the other! 
Wow, that is *so fast* if you are sending two different messages (to one 
list and the other) because if you carefully review the e-mail headers, 
the mailing list address is displayed in "To" field, in both cases. Not 
"CC" nor "BCC".

Anyway... who cares? Me not :-)
