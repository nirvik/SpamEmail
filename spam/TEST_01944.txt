[ILUG] One Command -- Four TypesI tried several ways to force the command ln to create a link with
an option attached . . . it wouldn't work.

How are there four (/bin/dnsdomainname /bin/domainname
/bin/nisdomainname /bin/ypdomainname) different types of hostname
links with their own separate options?
