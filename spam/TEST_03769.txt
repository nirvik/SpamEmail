Well, as I said in another branch of the thread, you can shrink most 
filesystems, including all extfs (I think the only bad boy here is XFS), 
look at resize2fs(8) from e2fsprogs for these.

Again, the solution is not necessarily better nor simpler, just different.

That's good, and I'd say that's even necessary if you don't have 
snapshotting tools (LVM2 is good at it).
