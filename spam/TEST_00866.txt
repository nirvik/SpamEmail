AUGD: RE: PR Mailing Listsgreets...

I would be happen to subscribe to ANY of
the MUG's PR lists -- and pass along info that
might be of value to the larger audience.

The complexion of the InfoManager subscriber and
RSS base has changed substantially to a non-ug
readership.

Groups who send out press releases and info about
events, etc., need to be conscience of the greater
audience.

For instance -- recently we got one that would have
been good to distribute -- about an event that Mac
users would probably travel 150 miles to attend.

But the content was written as if to members
of the local group who already knew everything about
the venue.

Another came out and looked GREAT ... and I would
have included it -- but it was all one big graphic.
No text what so ever. So it was impossible to deal
with as a press release.

Always remember the essential information assuming
the reader knows nothing about it.

:-)
