Yes, that's found it!  It appears that Netbeans explicitly sets =
-Dfile.encoding=3DUTF-8 in the java command line, whereas Xcode doesn't. =
 The presence of this command option causes the problem.  By default, =
Java on Mac appears to use "MacRoman" as the file encoding.

An apparent fix in Netbeans is to go to the project's Properties > Run =
page and set the VM Options to -Dfile.encoding=3DMacRoman

At first sight, this appears to fix the problem but I need to make more =
tests to be sure; I may come back if I find further issues.   =
Incidentally, trying to set the option with a System.setProperty () call =
didn't work.

Thanks to everyone who helped
