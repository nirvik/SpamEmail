That's because ">& build.log" is a bash-ism.  If dash is installed as /bin/=
sh=20
(which is useful, since it executes the start-up scripts faster), you might=

get this error.

You probably want "> build.log 2>&1" which (one of?) the standard, POSIX/SU=
S-
compatible way of re-directing both stdout and stderr to a single file name=
d=20
"build.log".  The ">&" shortcut that bash has is nice, but it is not portab=
le.
