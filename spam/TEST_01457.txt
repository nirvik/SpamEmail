I did nothing but issue startx.  No intervention 
to cause the server to shut down.

Selinux or MTRR, whatever it is?  See following.

Three selinux packages are installed.
  selinux-policy-default
  libselinux1
  python-selinux
Appears that I shouldn't remove libselinux1 at least.

yields
http://carnot.pathology.ubc.ca/dalton.Xorg.0.log

Now in the log there is no (EE) and no /dev/fb0.  
This is what appears on the screen after startx is issued.
