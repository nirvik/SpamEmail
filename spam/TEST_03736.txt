By choosing that term you are certainly attempting to frame the debate by
choosing a fear-charged word.

If somebody maximizes their gratification by slaughtering people, we
shouldn't just try to understand them. We should try to stop them. You
seem to have forgotten this in your moral relativism. Everybody is
justified in their own head. This doesn't mean we forgive mass murders,
or ignore their acts. They are still guilty and abhorrent. We do
understand them better when we see them as a flawed human being, like
any one of us.

Calling "the other side" evil is a time-honored tradition. It is less 
of a stepping point for an analysis of the situation than it is for an
analysis of human nature in general.

People require a touch more effort.
