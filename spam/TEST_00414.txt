The current Knoppix is alleged to be 100% binary compatible, beyond some 
kernel modules which are specific to the running kernel (which is always 
the case, even with official Debian).

64-bit Knoppix is in the TODO list of Klaus Knopper, but for rescue 
purposes, 32-bit should be able to do the job.

I agree that Debian itself would be best, that's why I asked about the 
installer, in rescue mode (found on disc 1 one of a standard Debian CD 
or DVD).

Does disc 1 of a distribution set fully support XFS?
