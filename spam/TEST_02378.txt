Not 100% true. A plain user who wants to keep on using KDE 3
will not be able to do so forever. A year or two are certainly possible
even though people will need a different browser for security &
HTML 5 & CSS reasons.
But realistically speaking, KDE 3's days are numbered and there
are a lot of people who can do nothing about it.
