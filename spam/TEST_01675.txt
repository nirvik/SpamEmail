RE: [Razor-users] FW: intigration with qmailThank you for your response I will verify that I have taken these steps
that you have metioned but as well I would like to stop mail from
entering my mail boxes and need the info about how to integrate with
qmail in newbie terms if that is possible.  Thank you again for your
help

i don't think you get exactly what razor does. razor is used to stop
spam
from entering a mail box, not to leave a mail server. altough you could
probably use it that way i doubt it would do much good (if the mail is
leaving the server, it most likely is a new spam and wouldn`t get caught
by
razor)

you might want to look into dealing with those troublesome users
directly.
and (as you`ve probably been screamed at a lot of times) close your open
relay if you have one, there are plenty of sites that tells you how
(most
RBL sites)
