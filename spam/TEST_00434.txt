[ILUG] eircom mailhi i was just wondering if anyone experiening difficulty with eircom mail
sever.I was trying to send mail from mozilla mail but it keeps coming up
with this error:
sorry,that domain isnt in my list of allows rcpthosts(#5.7.1)
please check the message recipients and try again.

What is this all about.
I am using mail2.eircom.net as my smtp and my pop, i can recieve mail but
i cannot send mail. is there any other open relay that i  can use.

Also i was just browsing the web and came across this
http://www.microsoft.com/ireland/security/info2.htm
Its a seminar on
<cough>security and reliable</cough>
maybe ilug should go along and hold a seminar on the same day right
across the hall from this!
