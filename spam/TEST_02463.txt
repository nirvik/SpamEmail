Re: About apt, kernel updates and dist-upgradeOn Mon, Feb 04, 2002 at 05:04:08PM +0200, Peter Peltonen wrote:

Look at /etc/apt/apt.conf. I think ^kernel$ matches the kernel packages
(apart from those matched by the rest, smp, enterprise).
I think it won't do anything about the kernels. Come to think of it, the
abovementioned might have nothing to do with it.

I explicitly use apt-get install kernel and then from the list pick a
version and then install kernel#2.4.foo-bar.

Should. Haven't tried with dist-upgrade but I have put 7.2 netboot
mirror (ie, 7.2) into sources.list and run install step-by-step for IIRC
everything. Worked ok. I think there'll be a few .rpmnew files worth
checking such as, especially, passwd and group.
I think there was a group change. "lock" ?
