[Razor-users] empty mail is spamm?Hi,

Is it possible to use razor without filtering empty mails as spamm?
An mail with an attachment is considered spamm. Is this normal?
Or I mysqlf like to send emails to myself where all important is said in
subject and body is empty (for remaining smth).

Thanks,
Raido Kurel
