Although my fingerprints are all over that, it's not actually my code and has 
been in there since before 1998.  (It's code that I moved from mh.tcl to 
sequences.tcl and back again).  I'm no5 sure either, but it should be a 
one-time penalty because the sequence will be re-written with the bad messages 
removed.  (I think.)

That *was* a problem, but if you look at Mh_Sequence (and Mh_Sequences and 
Mh_SequenceUpdate), they all call MhReadSeqs to do the actual reading and it 
only reads the sequences if the file has been touched.  Look for the 
"Exmh_Debug Reading $filename" output in the debug log to see when sequences 
are actually reread from disk.


My theory is that Ftoc_ShowSequences is being called too often.  I'm about to 
investigate that.

Thanks.
