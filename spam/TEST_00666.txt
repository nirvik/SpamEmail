Perhaps it exists in lenny but not in squeeze? My apt-file search also 
says that it exists, but I do not even have the directory in which the 
file is supposed to reside.

According to the debian site, however, the file is not available in squeeze:

<http://packages.debian.org/search?searchon=contents&keywords=fmex8.pfb&mode=exactfilename&suite=stable&arch=amd64>
<http://packages.debian.org/search?searchon=contents&keywords=fmex8.pfb&mode=exactfilename&suite=testing&arch=amd64>


It seems to come from a cmex package. Can that package have changed and 
dropped the fmex* files? It now seems to contain cmex*-files instead, 
but I do not know if that is the correct interpretation.
