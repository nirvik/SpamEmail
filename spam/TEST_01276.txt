Is it safe to update-rc.d remove defaults ntp with dependency boot
 in place?
=A0 As some of you might know=2C the transition to dependency based
boot / insserv is causing the following lines:

=A0=A0=A0 insserv: warning: current stop runlevel(s) (0 1 6) of script `ntp=
'
=A0 =A0 overwrites defaults (empty).

=A0 Is it safe for the system administrator to issue

=A0=A0=A0 update-rc.d remove defaults ntp
=A0=A0=A0 update-rc.d remove start 20 2 3 4 5 . stop 20 0 1 6 . ntp

?  That is=2C will such commands break something?

=A0 Some references are bugs 568974 and 183460.
