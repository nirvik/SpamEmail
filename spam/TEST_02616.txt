"Holiday Season" 2002 beginsIt's official, the holidays are here.  I got HTML mail from one of the 
little catalogs I've been known to purchase from....basically the front 
page of their first holiday catalog. 

Must have been released simultaneously with mailing for a delivery target 
of just after Labor Day.

Ick.
