invisible consoleI like an old-fashioned VGA text look on the console; in
/etc/default/console-setup I have

FONTFACE="VGA"
FONTSIZE="16"

This used to work.

But after a dist-upgrade around April 10th, the behaviour changed.

1 -- cold startup works normally (and looks normal).
2 -- startx works OK
3 -- pressing control-alt-f2 (to go to the console temporarily)
now gives a (framebuffer?) screen with very small letters; at the
top of the screen there is a message from "drm" stating that the
resolution is set to 1250 x 1024 (instead of 640 x 480 which is
what I want).
4 -- presing alt-f7 gets me back into X.
5 -- pressing control-alt-f2 AGAIN gives a completely black
screen. Nothing visible. Going back to X with alt-f7 is still
possible.

uname -a gives:
Linux vega 2.6.32-3-686 #1 SMP Thu Feb 25 06:14:20 UTC 2010 i686
GNU/Linux

This kernel was installed recently; booting an earlier kernel,
e.g. 2.6.29-2, gets the old (proper) behaviour back.

Configuration error? Or bug? If the latter, which package?

Regards, Jan
