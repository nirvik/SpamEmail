Nope, indeed IPFW2 has just been rolled out into -STABLE. (-STABLE
is a stable branch of the code that has been rolled into -CURRENT
first. It's basically a major release, that's still a work in
progress)

I don't really judge things by uptimes, it's rather like judging
penis size. People like comparing them, and the larger they are, the
more people are in awe of them, but overly large ones aren't really
practical!

Defiantely. I wouldn't like anyone to accuse me of being a
nit-picker though ;)

Well, as someone who's used ipchains quite heavily about two years
ago, I can guarantee you that the learning curve for reading
ipchains rules and ipfw rules is quite different. Of course once
you've memorised (not necessarily sitting down with a sheet of them
and learning them off by rote) them, you wonder what all the fuss is
about before.

It's not in itself a reason to choose one firewall product over
another, but if that's all there is in the difference, and the
learning curve for the Operating System is the same, then I know
what I'd prefer, as a beginner.

This is all getting rather off-topic now anyways, but since I've
been doing quite a lot of work with ipfw over the last week I jumped
on the bandwagon.
