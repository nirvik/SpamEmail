[Razor-users] Forged email addressI received a spam email that had apparently forged the From header with
my own email address. After reviewing the message I forwarded it with
the rest of a batch of spam ti the database with razor-report. Now of,
course, my own email address is listed int he Razor database. How do I
go about getting it removed.

I have seen this ploy (forged From headers) several time since then.
Perhaps the razor-report need to detect this and emit a warning.
