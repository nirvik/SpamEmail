_The Morning News_: Rosencrantz & Joshua[1]. Words fail me, which is a rare 
and pleasant gift, thank you. Instead, I will simply take this opportunity to 
quote the original _Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead_, the excellent 
play by Tom Stoppard which I keep nestled in my one remaining bookshelf[2] 
between the _Tao Te Ching_ and Roald Dahl's _Charlie and the Chocolate Factory_
. 

    Guil: Exactly, it's a matter of asking the right questions and giving away 
    as little as we can. It's a game.
    Ros: And then we can go?
    Guil: And receive such thanks as fits a king's remembrance.
    Ros: I like the sound of that. Waht do you think he meant by remembrance?
    Guil: He doesn't forget his friends.
    Ros: Would you care to estimate?
    Guil: Difficult to say, really&#8212;some kings tend to be amnesiac, others 
    I suppose&#8212;the opposite, whatever that is...
    Ros: Yes&#8212;but&#8212;
    Guil: Elephantine... ?
    Ros: Not how long&#8212;how much?
    Guil: _Retentive_&#8212;he's a very retentive king, a royal retainer...
    Ros: What are you playing at?
    Guil: Words, words. They're all we have to go on.
