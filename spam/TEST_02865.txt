  "They" probably haven't fixed it since it hasn't been reported as
 a bug.

   Either:

    * Say nothing.

    * Rant in an unproductive fashion, without sufficient details to
      come to any conclusion.

    * Report a bug.

  Anything else is a waste of your time, and ours.  (e.g. "File
 downloads are broken"?  Not for me.  But with so few details
 people will either ignore you, suspect you're trolling, or blame it
 on user-error.)

  Happily it seems that you're content using Iceweasel, so pragmatically
 you should continue to do that...
