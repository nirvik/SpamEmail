Chromium in SidGood morning folks.

Why is the Chromium-browser in Sid so old? Chromium has been on the
6.x branch for a couple of weeks now and Debian is still using the 5.x
branch.

In my opinion we should keep up with the new releases at least weekly.
Is this on the agenda to do?

Cheers,
