RE: [SAtalk] Debianized Packages for SA 2.3+I successfully installed spamassassin & razor to run system wide on my
Debian Woody server.  
 
Briefly I 
apt-get installed spamassassin razor and libmilter-dev,
 
downloaded spamass-milter-0.1.2.tar.gz from http://www.milter.org,
ungzipped and untarred the file into /etc/mail, 
 
followed the directions in /etc/mail/spamass-milter-0.1.2/README to
compile the milter, install the rc scripts, and edit and update
sendmail.mc
 
changed /etc/default/spamassassin to set spamassassin to daemon mode.
 
verified that spamassassin was running by tailing /var/log/mail.log
 
 
Woody/stable has SA 2.20
Woody/unstable has SA 2.41

I'm running the stable source live right now and it is working very
well.

If you want unstable change /etc/apt/sources.list, substituting
"unstable" for "stable",
Run apt-get update
Install the unstable versions
Change /etc/apt/sources.list
Run apt-get update

Im currently using woody.

Is there a debianized package for SA on Woody, or at least somewhere I
can download from? Its been soo long that I haven't compiled stuff, that
Im sort of shy to try again. =)
