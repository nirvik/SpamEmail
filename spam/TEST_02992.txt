Re: applets on 32-bit 1.6.0_20Have just tested my applet on a 64-bit Mac, and it seems,

* you have to select the 'In their own process' preference, in order
to stop the flicker-on-resize

* unticking the 64-bit Java checkbox greys out the radio buttons that
let you make the above change.

Ergo, the non-flickering applet container is only available on 64-bit Macs.

If anyone from Apple could clarify the situation, I'd be much obliged.
