[zzzzteana] Frog Fall at CheapsideNear the end of his *Memoirs of Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the
Madness of Crowds* (1851), Charles Mackay discusses various catch phrases
briefly popular in mid-19th-century London. One of them, he observes,
"like a mushroom, seems to have sprung up in the night, or, like a frog in
Cheapside, to have come down in a sudden shower. One day it was unheard,
unknown, uninvented; the next it pervaded London."

Was "like a frog in Cheapside" (or something similar) a catch phrase
itself, or did Mackay come up with the simile on his own?

And to what event or events does it refer?

I didn't find anything relevant in Partridge's *A Dictionary of Catch
Phrases.*
