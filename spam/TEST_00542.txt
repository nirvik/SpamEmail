Impossible without modifying .hptalx, as the application directly bugs when I type
`hptalx'. This is instantaneous.

I just renamed .hptalx in .hptalx2, and the program starts normally,
without bugging.

Pressing `O.K.' does not make the app bugging, but once I click on
`Connect', bug buddy directly arises! (And, without the connection
capability, the program is totally unuseful, as it is its goal.)

~$ cat .hptalx

Strange, really. I compiled it the other day, and the whole process
went through without any issue.
