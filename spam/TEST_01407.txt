Do you read the news?

Do you know the WAR between Adobe and Apple?

Adobe opened the SWF format some days ago.

IF Adobe want to survive they have to open the specs.  And I think, they
will continue the success as with Acrobat which is definitively the best
PDF creater of the world...  Also I think, it is time for Adobe to  port
there programs to GNU/Linux Operating System.
