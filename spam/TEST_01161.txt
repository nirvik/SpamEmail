Well I see the problem.  The autogenerated expect script is waiting for 
the exact output of ShowStats that it had the first time you ran 
autoexpect, which I assume will be different every time, not the same.

So, change the part that says:

expect --exact "ShowStats\r ...blah blah lots of stats ... BSC1_1_1-> "

to just:

expect "BSC1_1_1-> "
