Re: Ximian apt repos?[branching the thread, here]

    I found another Ximian repository- I don't know if it works yet...

rpm     http://gstreamer.net/releases/redhat/ redhat-73-i386 deps
rpm-src http://gstreamer.net/releases/redhat/ redhat-73-i386 deps

rpm     http://gstreamer.net/releases/redhat/ redhat-73-i386 deps ximian
rpm-src http://gstreamer.net/releases/redhat/ redhat-73-i386 deps ximian

rpm     http://gstreamer.net/releases/redhat/ redhat-73-i386 deps gnomehide
rpm-src http://gstreamer.net/releases/redhat/ redhat-73-i386 deps gnomehide

    These guys are EXTREMELY apt-friendly.  Unlike most multimedia projects, they seem to prefer RPM/Apt over the older methods.  Isn't that cool?

    Hey- how would I have known to "apt-get install gnome-session" to kick all this off?
