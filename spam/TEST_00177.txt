1) Right click on the folder label in the folder list

2) In the main window, the "+" key puts you into a "change 
   folder" mode (the first time you use it after starting exmh),
   hit a second + and you go to "set a target" mode.  Type a few
   characters of the folder name and hit space for autocomplete.
