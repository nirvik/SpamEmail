Re: My brain hurts
You're in luck because my mom sends these all the time and I never
have anything else to do with them ...

 An old man lived alone in Minnesota. He wanted to spade his potato garden,
but it was very hard work.
 His only son, who would have helped him, was in Prison. The old man  wrote
a  letter to his son and mentioned his predicament.
 Shortly, he received this reply, "For heaven's sake Dad, don't dig up  that
garden, that's where I buried the GUNS!"
 At 4 A.M. the next morning, a dozen police showed up and dug up the old
man's entire garden, without finding any guns.
 Confused, the old man wrote another note to his son telling him what
happened, and asking him what to do next.
 His son's reply was: "Now plant your potatoes, Dad. It's the best
I could  do  at this time."

but better than that, just settle into this, courtesy of daypop:
