Morten Frederiksen has taken a first stab at a real-time social network 
explorer based on FOAF files. You could start on my profile[1] and explore from 
there, or enter the URL of your own FOAF file (at the bottom of the page). It's 
heavy on tech details, but you can easily see the potential here. (It's also a 
great way to debug your FOAF file, if you added anything manually.) Now we need 
somebody to build a spider that follows foaf:knows links and draws pretty 
social network diagrams, so we can see the forest for the trees.
