Antimissile defense is designed to operate in ~LEO environment, and knocks
out stuff by kinetic kill or nearby nuking (damage by neutron flux
impacting the fissibles). It is *not* designed to apply a 100 MT warhead
(we don't have these, and synchonous impact is even more out of question)  
detonate-on-impact to a 28 km/s rock or rubble target. A 100 MT warhead
most assuredly will scarcely fragment a 2 km target in the few seconds
left before the impact. This is so obvious it doesn't even to need to be
modeled.

The anti-missile defense is about worse than useless in this case. The
only way to protect is determining orbits at high precision and deflecting
long-term. Decades for targets this size.
