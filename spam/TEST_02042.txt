Yes, you do have to look at them once.

The effects do make you feel sick? The only effects you will see to
get to the System Settings is the transparency. I have a lot of
experience in environmentally-induced reactions (my mother, autistics,
and by the way I am a trained medic though I currently do not work in
the field), and I simply do not believe that transparency will cause a
reaction. Nothing flashes or spins, which are the two established and
recognized visual triggers.

You are right, you must type the first three letters in KDE 4.

Thanks, I'm a good year removed from KDE 3. In any case, you can set
Alt-F1 as the Kmenu shortcut.

That's why I'm here. I'm not trying to push you into using KDE 4. I'm
trying to learn what you dislike about KDE 4 so that I can file issues
and get things fixed. But I won't do that on trivial things, such as
non-essential default settings.

No, if you tell me about usability issues, regressions, or just plain
bugs in KDE 4 I will work to resolve them. I have filed or triages
over 1300 bugs in KDE, most for users and not for myself.

You did not point out what is not functional. I am here to fix KDE 4.
I am not here for philosophy.

I don't want you to agree with me. I want you to point out the
problems so that I can fix them.

I am not trying to persuade you to do anything other than share your
KDE problems with me, so that I might get them resolved. KDE 3
holdouts are holding out because they are sensitive to the little
usability issues that make a great desktop environment. I need that
input so that I might get KDE 4 as great as KDE 3. I want to know what
is not intuitive, and what doesn't work.
