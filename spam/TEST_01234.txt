[ILUG] yast2has anyone had a problem with Yast2 not being able to
mount a source medium for installing new packages, on
suse 8.0?

it finds the directory containing the source, so the
installation program gets as far as selecting
packages, and formatting, but then says it can't mount
the source directory?
