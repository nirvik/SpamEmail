I'll second that, although with emphasis
upon /dump/, rather than on /political/.

I don't mind if people advocate nuking
gay baby whales for jesus, if they can
make a good, original, argument for it.

I do mind if someone should attempt to
further the notion that 1+1=2, merely
by cut-and-pasting a few pages of W&R.

"New bits" are not a temporal property;
we create them when we add context or
clarification to the old bits of others'
thoughts.

Now, an economist might argue that selling
offices is the most efficient way to fill
them (what would Coase say?), but wouldn't
that convince everyone (but the supporters
of plutocracy) that efficiency is not the
primary virtue of politics?
