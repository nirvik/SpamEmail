I am now preparing a small patch to configure.in for NetBSD (possibly
also useful for Open- and FreeBSD, don't know). Should be ready and
tested in the next half hour.

If you think 2.40 is ready, I would suggest to wait just 24 hours more
for possible reports by b2_4_0 users. Not everyone can follow the
development during daytime (at work).
