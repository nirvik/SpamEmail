Eric Eldred _himself_ was just on Marketplace[1]. 

NYTimes: Debate to Intensify on Copyright Extension Law[2] (front page of the 
business section, below the fold). " It will fall to Mr. Lessig, who is a 
former clerk for Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia and who has become a kind 
of rock star for the digital liberties set, to convince the justices to accept 
the unconventional analysis. If they do, the decision could be a turning point 
in redefining a balance between copyright consumers and producers — and the 
technology companies that are often in the middle." 

Newsweek: Glitterati vs. Geeks[3]. "Larry Lessig admits it: he’s nervous. Who 
wouldn’t be? [...] In its narrowest context, Eldred v. Ashcroft deals with the 
seemingly arcane issue of the length of copyrights for books, films and music. 
But it’s actually a high-noon showdown between two great industries at odds in 
the age of the Internet." 'There’s a sense of deja vu to this. Television was 
supposed to be the death of movies. And in 1982, the film industry’s 
silver-tongued lobbyist Jack Valenti testified that “the VCR is to the American 
film producer and the American public as the Boston strangler is to the woman 
home alone.” (Video sales are now the studios’ biggest moneymaker.) Naturally, 
Hollywood regards the computer/Internet combo as scarier than “Nightmare on Elm 
Street.”'
