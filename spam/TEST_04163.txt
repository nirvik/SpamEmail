Your corpora are biased in this respect though -- newsgroups have a
strong social taboo on posting HTML, but in many people's personal
inboxes it is quite abundant.

Getting a good ham corpus may prove to be a bigger hurdle than I
though!  My own saved mail doesn't reflect what I receive, since I
save and throw away selectively (much more so than in the past :-).

I'll bite.  Sounds like a good idea to strip the HTML in this case;
I'd like to see how this improves the f-p rate on this corpus.
