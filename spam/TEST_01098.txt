Oops, sorry, I'll try to pay attention to that more in the future. I apologize.

Can you post a link? I'd like to comment on that!

I see two reasons why that bug was ignored:
1) It's an upgrade issue, and apparently the dev who works on Krunner
(yes, I know who that is) does not consider upgrades a common use
case. KDE 3 never existed?!? This attitude is seen throughout Plasma,
even in minor-version upgrades.
2) It's wordy. Don't mention Linux-Magazine or other irrelevant
things. Just the bug, as concise as possible. Wordy bugs are almost
always ignored. I'm not blaming you, just giving you a hint as to how
to get the devs' attention.
