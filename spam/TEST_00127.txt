What method?

Getters and setters are a bad idea, just verbosity of language. Retrieving a value from an object should be as simple as:

a := b.c

where c could be a variable or a function. You should not be able to tell. That way you can always change the implementation.

However,

b.c := <expression>

you do want the object b to check that it is valid to set c to the value of the expression. If you are not using garbage collection, you want the common idiom of reference counting statements generated for you.

Objective-C 2.0 is a great improvement in terms of you don't have to write so much junk (well, repetitive code). However, @property and @synthesize aren't exactly ideal, but just look at what you have to write without them.
