Still worthwhile -- 1.257% is not that bad.  :-)

My results:

  OVERALL%   SPAM% NONSPAM%     S/O    RANK   SCORE  NAME
    11774     4079     7695    0.35    0.00    0.00  (all messages)
  100.000   34.644   65.356    0.35    0.00    0.00  (all messages as %)
    0.195    0.564    0.000    1.00    0.75    1.00  T_ROT13_EMAIL_3
    0.161    0.466    0.000    1.00    0.73    1.00  T_ROT13_EMAIL_2
    0.161    0.466    0.000    1.00    0.73    1.00  T_ROT13_EMAIL

The interesting thing is that these hits all seem to be rot13 versions
of the To: address.  If we ever start getting FPs (or if anyone is
worried), we could make it an eval test for rot13 of the To: address
(turning non-word characters into "." characters in the regular
expression).

At the same time, it might be worth testing for username in HTML
comments.  I found some <!--quinlan--> types in HTML comments, but I
haven't seen enough hits so far to bother (however, I did add a really
good test for email addresses in comments).
