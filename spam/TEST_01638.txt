Nope, this is "normal" as Red Hat removed all mp3 support from 8.0 because
of patent and royalty issues :-(
On freshrpms.net, you can find the xmms mp3 plugin as I said, but also
libmad, lame (mp3 encoder), and soon mpg321 as I often used it myself.
Many other players can also play mp3 files, like alsaplayer, xine, mplayer.

This is not normal though...
Try "mplayer -vo help" then try usinf various output methods to see if some
do work or not.
