I have noted this.  But for me it is a long-term solution.  a) I have to be=

sure that what I am looking for is not there.  It might just be I who am=20
being blind.  And b) I have to get my head round how to submit a bug. =20
Meanwhile, I manage to get the answers to many of my questions by just=20
