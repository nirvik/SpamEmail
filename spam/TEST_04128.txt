But I've long found the 'recommends' concept to be somewhat tricky and
perhaps to vary from maintainer to maintainer.  For example, mesa-utils
needs GLX, which, practically speaking, means that you need
libgl1-mesa-dri.  The maintainer refuses to make this even a
recommends, basically since the X server can run on a different machine:

Now, I'd bet (although I suppose that I may be wrong) that the vast
majority of Debian installations have the X server and clients on the
same machine, and the other case is probably the more 'unusual' one.

OTOH, acpi-support 'recommends' radeontool, even though this package is
utterly irrelevant to those without ATI Radeon chipsets:
