[ILUG] Digital CamerasHas anyone had any experience with using a digital camera with Linux, I'm
thinking of buying one. The camera will definitely be a HP camera (Since I
work for them and get a company discount) either a photosmart 318 or a
photosmart 120 and I would prefer to know before I buy if I can get it to
work or not
