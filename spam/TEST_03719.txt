you have to use sizes supported by the plotter, no?

KPrinter or gnome printer have their own rendering engines to translate to
printer language (as far as I know).

I had a lot of headache years ago. We finally upgraded the firmmemory on one
of the printers that was printing junk in certain cases. It took about 2
weeks to find out and a lot of paper. Luckily we had 3 from the same model
and we noticed on the other 2 one and the same document was printed fine
but on the 3rd one it was failing. That much on commercial software...

I'm not sure that the AcroReader on the client knows the PPD on the server.
Did you install on both the same ppd? I'm also not sure that it is using it
at all to create the printable. I think it's the cups server that can not
prepare the printable for the printer.

You can try using the ppds from the plotters manufacturer. This was very
useful approach in many cases.

Also I would try printing the same document from Adobe on Windows or Mac.
