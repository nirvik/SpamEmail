Strange... all my openssh packages don't explicitly requires a version of
openssl. What version of openssh do you have? Is it an official Red Hat
package? I suppose it isn't, and using Red Hat's rpms will solve your
problem.

What you need to know for openssl is :
0.9.5b is libcrypto.so.0 and libssl.so.0
0.9.6  is libcrypto.so.1 and libssl.so.1
0.9.6b is libcrypto.so.2 and libssl.so.2

Now in all Red Hat packages I've seen so far, the only dependency is on
those files and not on "openssl = version".
