Another low probability eventSo, a new family moved in down the street, with two kids, making us very
excited that there might be a child around the same age (20 months) as our
daughter Tatum. While we're talking to the family, we discover that their
daughter Kiara was born the same day as Tatum, within two hours, in the same
exact maternity ward. Both mothers were undoubtedly in labor at the same
time.

Wow.
