Well, in sylheed's "claws" branch you need to wait a bit for the developers
to backport all the updates from the main branch before getting a release
with the same version number.

Right now, the latest "claws" release is still 0.8.2claws :

But as it's the primary mailer I use, you can be sure that as soon as it's
updated to 0.8.3, I'll update my build! :-)
