As for the download problem, I didn't report a bug because someone else
got there first: Debian bug report number 563056.  I just checked back
and it has been marked "resolved", but apparently that version has not
yet migrated to Squeeze, which is what I am running.

As for the reply bug, I just noticed it today; and no, I haven't
reported a bug yet.  I'm not sure I'm going to.  I already said why.
I'm not going to give out my password.  And unless the package maintainer
happens to have a Wow e-mail account, which is unlikely, they won't
be able to reproduce the problem.  And then some wise guy like you
will say, "Well, Mr. Powell, if we can't reproduce the problem, how
do you expect us to fix it?"  I do not hesitate to report bugs.
If you don't believe me, search the bug database for my e-mail id.
