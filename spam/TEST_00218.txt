Video Streaming SoftwareI have been searching and searching for a specific type of software,
however I can't find anything that is 100% free and doesn't have any
hitches to it.

What I am looking for is some software that will allow me to take a
live video stream from my computer and stream it to multiple clients.
Kind of like how NullSoft does Audio Streaming, yes I know NullSoft
does Video also but at the moment to do a live video there is only
really one program that hasn't been updated in years.
