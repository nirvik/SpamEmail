Web pages usually make use of CSS styles to render those types, so when 
you copy/paste the content into a plain text document, the format gets 
lost. That's a normal behaviour.

Besides the tip Cameron provided, I add another one (only for GNOME):

- Press Control-R and then press Shift-R (keep those pressed at the same 
time)
- Now press "u" and release the three keys (it will appear an underline 
"u" in the screen)
- Then type "00b2" and press Enter

That will render into "²" :-)

There is a small list of secuences in this page:
