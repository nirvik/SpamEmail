Possible - should be, it was possible to update to (null) from RH7.3 with 
apt. Did that on my laptop and well.. it was painfull to say the least 
(including a ecovery from totally corrupted rpmdb) Don't expect it to be 
an easy 'dist-upgrade' at any rate, so much stuff has changed and apt 
doesn't always handle all that well the way dependencies are set in 
RHL.

It's possible but not supported by RH. I've upgraded both my laptop and my 
home box from (null) to RH8.0 and didn't encounter any issues though.
