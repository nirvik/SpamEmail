IMHO, I doubt it would help. There will always be cases where it is very=20
difficult to draw the line between Depends: vs Recommends: (see the not=20
very long ago flames about making xorg depend on hal) and also=20
Recommends: vs Suggests:

An interesting proposal a while ago was to be able to add some more=20
information to Suggests:, something like:

Package: acpi-support
Suggests: radeontool (backlight control for ATI Radeon based laptops)
