Martin, The correct display resolution for your monitor is "1360x768", I 
suggest you use that resolution, for Windows I suggest you use the 
driver that came with your monitor, if you do not have the driver I 
suggest you contact LG, if you are not happy with your monitor then take 
it back and get something else.

If your wallpaper is not made for wide screen or you are not using .svgz 
wallpaper then it will not look right, only with "1360x768" will your 
applications, games and movies look right.
