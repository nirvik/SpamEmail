Imap servers that support the MH folder/file standards
>>>From time to time I have to travel, and seem to end up with a rather slow
link back home that makes remote display of exmh rather slow, even over
ssh and/or VNC. What I'd  like to do is use an imap capable mailer to
communicate with an imap server that is serving up my MH folders. Does
anyone know of any Imap servers that can do this? I'd like it to be able
to handle the  mailstore using MH commands so things don't get out of
sync. At the moment I use a combo of fetchmail and procmail to handle
soring things when I'm local, and it's possible that an imap server
would mung this when I deleted a message remotely.
