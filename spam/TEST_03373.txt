   Thanks for posting this tip - I had the same problem compiling with
Tru64 and that took care of it.

   When I did the "make install" I got this error:

LOCK:  -f /etc/mail/spamassassin/local.cf
 || cp rules/local.cf /etc/mail/spamassassin/local.cf
sh: syntax error at line 1: `||' unexpected
*** Exit 2
Stop.

   It appears that this comes from the "inst_cfs:" part of the Makefile,
which copies local.cf into /etc/mail/spamassassin.  The Makefile has
brackets around the -f test, but they don't show up above.  Any ideas?
