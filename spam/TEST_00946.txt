7 beeps OK, 8th always very low volume. Being root, or using tty1 gives
no improvement. modprobe pcspkr no help.

The first few seconds of
$ beep -l 11111
are normal, the remainder very low volume. The number of seconds vary.
How does one toggle auto-suspending, if indeed that is the problem?
