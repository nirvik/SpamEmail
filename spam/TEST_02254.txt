I'll note that in the README.

OK; maybe rewriting the message-ids will help here, that should allow
us to pick them out.  I'll do that.

nah, me neither.

Yep.  The primary reason I released this, was to provide a good, big
corpus for academic testing of filter systems; it allows results to
be compared between filters using a known corpus.

For SpamAssassin development, everyone has to maintain their own corpus.
