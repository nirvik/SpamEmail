Supply a mod to tokenizer.py and I'll test it (eventually <wink>).  Note
that the tokenizer already *preserves* case in subject-line words, because
experiment showed that this was better than folding case away in this
specific context (but experiment also showed-- against my
expectations --that preserving case everywhere didn't make a significant
difference to either error rate -- the subject line is a special case for
this).
