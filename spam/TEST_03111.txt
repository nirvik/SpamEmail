not my obsession - evolutions.

anyway.. i dont like mice and rats, esp. not in the house. and we've
not had one in the house since we got our present cat.

:)

its mostly mice though. and they will eventually (after a few summers)
stop bringing their kills back to the house, once they realise that
you're not interested and are never going to learn to hunt.

(they're trying to teach you hunting basically. they do the same with
kittens - first bring back kills, and then later they bring back live
but injured prey for the kittens to practice on).

although they'll still bring back stuff on occassion.
