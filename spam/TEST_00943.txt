ount:

GNU nano 2.0.7              File: /etc/fstab

# /etc/fstab: static file system information.

errors=3Dremount-ro 0            1

/dev/hda          /media/cdrom0    udf,iso9660 user,noauto         0

so, none of the media that i plug in is listed here. perhaps that is
because i always use the hotplug?
