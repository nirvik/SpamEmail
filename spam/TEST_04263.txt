That comment really strikes home.  We are working on a potential major
Windows desktop replacement project.  The two things that are absolutely
killing us are email and a viable substitute for Acrobat Standard.  We
can roughly mimic everything Acrobat does but only with create
complexity, taking ten times longer to get it done, using several
applications in the process, having less than comparable results, and
making the process detestable to the end users who wonder why would
anyone give up Windows for this.  There are couple of admirable efforts
out there but they have a very, very long way to go - John
