Sounds like some kind of deadlock, but without a debugger or  
diagnostics, it's gonna be hard to pin it down.  Good luck; I suspect  
figuring out how to run the debugger within the 30-second window is  
gonna be the hardest part of this.

You should be able to send a SIGQUIT to the hung process (after  
wakeup) and get a thread-dump.  That might reveal something.

You might try simplifying the static method, so it doesn't write to  
System.out.  Instead, do something much simpler, like increment a  
static counter with no synchronization, and do no I/O at all.  If  
that works, do simple file I/O, like writing one byte to an already- 
open file, and flushing to disk.  Basic strategy: start dead simple  
and work up.  println() is simple to understand or invoke, but the  
implementation isn't nearly as simple as one might think.
