If you are using system-wide definitions, edit /etc/dir_colors and
comment the offending line. There should be one.
Also, check the manpage `man dircolors'. You might want to rebuild the
definitions. Backup /etc/dir_colors before. Better yet, does
`dircolors -b' contain the offending line causing the error?
I'm guessing you use bash.
