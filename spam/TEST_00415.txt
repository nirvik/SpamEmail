That dynamic linker doesn't look right. A little googling shows that
Redhat and Suse seem to be using that one now. A missing linker is,
by the way, the only other reason for execve() to return ENOENT ("file
not found") I know of - missing dependencies produce a different error.

Anyway, Debian still has /lib/ld-linux.so.2 - you could try symlinking
them, but I doubt it will work.
