One year ago today, my (now former) manager told me to shut down my weblog and 
remove all traces of it from my server. He tried to convince me that the 
Internet was too small to mix the professional[1] and the personal[2]. 

One year ago today, I gave him my answer[3], and the rest is history[4]. 

Today, to celebrate this anniversary, I would like everyone to read my resume
[5], admire this full-screen picture of my cat[6], and link to this post[7]. 

There are four lights.
