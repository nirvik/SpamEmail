Please correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe you don't actually set prefer=
ences to install recommends.  This is now the Debian default.  You have to =
explicitly turn them off if you don't want them.

To avoid this, you should place these lines in /etc/apt/apt.conf:

APT::Install-Recommends "0";
APT::Install-Suggests "0";

I agree -- recommends are not depends, and they should not be automatic.  A=
nd yet they are.

(Also note that I have the above lines in my apt.conf and I *still* got net=
work-manger.)
