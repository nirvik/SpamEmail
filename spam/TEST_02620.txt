The update-java-alternatives command should sort this out.
This will show you the available alternatives:
     /usr/sbin/update-java-alternatives --list

Then as root run something like
    update-java-alternatives -s java-6-sun

Note there's a load of java-related items which that command sets. To
see the list, run 
    /usr/sbin/update-java-alternatives --verbose --list
