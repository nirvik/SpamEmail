update-alternatives --config firefox-javaplugin.so now returns:

There is only 1 program which provides firefox-javaplugin.so
(/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk/jre/lib/i386/gcjwebplugin.so). Nothing to
configure.

This has been my problem all along -- how to get update-alternatives to
recognize *any* alternative except the ones provided by debian packages,
the one mentioned above, the sun-java6 6-12-1 set of packages and java-gcj.

Likely the next step, unless I can use the java version in
lenny-backports non-free.
