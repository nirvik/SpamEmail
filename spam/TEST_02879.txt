I really doubt that! /bin/sh should be a symbolic link (symlink) to=20
either /bin/bash or /bin/dash (depending on the release you are using).

Of course, /bin/sh is needed for the basic operation of your OS, it=20
couldn't reside on /usr (which is often a separate partition mounted=20
later on).

Try putting this in ~/.bashrc:

export EDITOR=3D/usr/bin/vim
