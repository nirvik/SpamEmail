I doubt it, because I think that the problem is the basic philosophy.  They 
have sacrificed funtionality in favour of glitz.

E.g.
1. You cannot turn off all those horrible, and to me actually physically 
painful (I have problems with my eyes) "special effects" _before_ being 
subjected to them.  (All that horrible wobbly, wavy, shimmery, spinning 
transparent glitz.)
2. ctrl+tab does not move to the next window.
3. alt+F2 is cumbersome and unhelpful.  (In KDE 3.5.x I can type e.g. k and be 
presented with a list of all the applications that I have previously used 
beginning with k.)
4. Alt+F1 does not bring up the menu.
5. Kcontrol no longer exists.
etc etc.

Why would I rather have a Toyota hatchback (especially a hybrid one) than a 
two seater sports car?
