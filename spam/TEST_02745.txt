Should be easyI'm running updated Lenny.  I just got a droid phone and wanted to mount it on 
my Lenny box.  So, I plugged the USB cable into the droid and the computer.  
I expected to see an sd? device show up with partitions (like sdb1, sdb2, 
etc.) but they don't show up.  My primary HD shows up as sda1-7.  There are 
entries for sdb,c,d,e and sdf, but no partitions to mount.

What do I have to do to mount the Droid under Lenny?

Thanks,

Mark
