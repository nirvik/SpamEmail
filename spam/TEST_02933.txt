Naw.  It ain't so.  Most US users don't even know what a UPS is.  APC 
quit calling their equipment a "UPS", and now just call it a "backup 
battery" because of alphabet soup fatigue.  And Jane Church-Secretary 
still doesn't know what it is or what it's for.  Or or Jack 
Retired-Contractor.  Joe Average.
