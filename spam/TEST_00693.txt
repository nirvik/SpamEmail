You assume that they just match people up and marry them off, and neither is
attracted to the other, which is not the case. Even this has arranged
marrage beat by a long way.

Males gets: A wife for a while, and if they actually like each other, for a
long time.
Female gets: Into Britan, out of a country with no real rights for women, no
opportunities for her or her children, out of the polution, AIDS, and an
uncountable number of scary tropical diseases. Not to mention in most cases
living conditions that us spoiled Americans cannot even comprehend.

Yea, the women is definately getting tha bad end of the deal here.

You're so easy to taunt :)
