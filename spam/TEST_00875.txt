For KDE 2 -> 3, this was true. I had 128 or 256 MiB of RAM back then
and when they announced that KDE 3 would use _less_ RAM, I laughed.
Well, they proved me wrong and KDE 3 gave new life to an old machine.

With KDE 4.1, I was forced to upgrade from 512 MiB RAM to 1.2 GiB
to get from "pretty static pictures" to "slow".

As said earlier, I have KDE 4 on a pretty new machine and KDE 3 on an
ancient one. If anything, a _lot_ more in installed & running on the KDE 3
machine.
The KDE 3 machine is noticably faster in pretty much every regard.

YMMV.

Nope, pure Qt/KDE 4.
