I have no clue about ffs but...

In the 2.4 kernel source Documentation/Configure.help there are various kernel 
options CONFIG_JFF* that enable it.

http://developer.axis.com/software/jffs/ and http://sources.redhat.com/jffs2/ 
are the URLs cited in that documentation. They have links to mailing lists and 
archives which may be able to answer more specific questions.

If you mean Amiga ffs, then thats selectable in the kernel config also :)

Cheers,
