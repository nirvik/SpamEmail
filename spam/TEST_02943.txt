[SAdev] [Bug 1054] New: Split up FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMShttp://www.hughes-family.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1054

           Summary: Split up FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS
           Product: Spamassassin
           Version: unspecified
          Platform: Other
        OS/Version: other
            Status: NEW
          Severity: enhancement
          Priority: P2
         Component: Rules
        AssignedTo: spamassassin-devel@example.sourceforge.net
        ReportedBy: matt@nightrealms.com


The current FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS triggers on any from where the user name ends
in two or more digits.  I think this should be split up into different
numbers of trailing digits, so that rules with different S/O ratios can
get different scores.  So I've made test rules that look from From
names that end with two, three, four, or five digitis, and one for six or
more digitis; I also put in a test rule that looks for Froms that end in a
single digit, just the sake of completeness.

Here is what I got:

OVERALL%   SPAM% NONSPAM%     S/O    RANK   SCORE  NAME
  15113     4797    10316    0.32    0.00    0.00  (all messages)
100.000   31.741   68.259    0.32    0.00    0.00  (all messages as %)
  1.244    3.877    0.019    1.00    0.64    0.01  T_FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS6
  0.576    1.459    0.165    0.90    0.43    0.01  T_FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS5
  4.982   10.694    2.326    0.82    0.38    0.01  T_FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS4
  3.434    6.337    2.084    0.75    0.35    0.01  T_FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS3
  8.979   12.383    7.396    0.63    0.30    0.01  T_FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS2
  8.847    6.817    9.791    0.41    0.22    0.01  T_FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS1

I should note that I get rather bad S/O's for FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS, probably
because so much of my corpus is made up of Yahoo! Groups traffic, which
seems to have a lot of users that like sticking numbers at the ends of their
names.  Here is the normal stats for FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS:

  7.024   28.480    2.834    0.91    0.50    0.88  FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS

and my stats:

 19.228   34.793   11.991    0.74    0.35    0.88  FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS
