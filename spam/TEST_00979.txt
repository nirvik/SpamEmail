personally I choose the shortest way to write things in almost all cases.

if I only execute one command on true/false conditions, I prefer:
command && react_true || react_false

if reaction consists of multiple commands, I prefer:
if command; then
	...
else
	...
fi

using a temporary variable (and an extra assignment step) is only
reasonable for me, if I need to remember that one exit status later on
for whatever reason.

tmp=0
command || tmp=1
some_commands
...
if [ $tmp -eq 1 ]; then
	...
else
	...
fi

But yeah, many ways are possible, achieving the same result...

Best regards

Mart
