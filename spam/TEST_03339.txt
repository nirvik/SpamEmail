The associated links cover that: The surface temperature in spots
frequented by people is warmer (hence all our groundbased sensors
reporting global warming) although the overall environmental
temperature is decreasing.

Apparently, the real news is not that there is no global warming, but
that our models of the warming were seriously flawed by naive
convection models.  This too was not news to the theoreticians: All
that has happened is that NASA has confirmed the naiive convection
concerns.
