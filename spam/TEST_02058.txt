[zzzzteana] RE: Argh!I think I understand the feeling.  A few years ago I caught up with
a couple of old fiancés, both now authors and notable in their
field.  One is a minor celebrity - perhaps I should say 'was'
because fame can be so fleeting and I do not know the
current status but she still commands buck$ on the lecture
circuit.  I authored some technical material through the
years which are probably long forgotten.  I am also 'notable',
sort of, kind of, in some very narrow fields (how many
mando-bass artists could there be?) so have that
feather in my cap if I cared about it.

I feel I am only a little jealous or depressed thinking about my
own accomplishments (or lack thereof) - what does
bug me is that these 2 probably have some real good
juicy stories and I'm not getting to hear any of them!!
That's one reason I love this list...
