Every HD that is even remotely close to being usable will always have
zero bad blocks when seen from outside the HD. All HDs have error
recognition and error correction and automatic replacement of faulty
sectors with spare ones. A HD will only show bad blocks after all of its
remapping area is used, at which point it is far beyond being usable.

In other words, scanning for bad blocks on a HD cannot work.

You can see the internal count of the remapped sectors with SMART, as
others have already pointed out here.
