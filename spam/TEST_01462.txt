syslog-ng log output corrupted
a few days ago syslog-ng stopped working properly on my=20
laptop.

Its output consists only of error report lines such as the following:

This started when the /var partition filled up due to an=20
update (without cleaning up old debs before). In an 'emergency'
clean up i deleted also old, compressed log files (as i usually do).

This has happened before without an consequences, but now what ever=20
i try (de/reinstall, pure/reinstall) the problem persists.

I switched to sysklogd which work absolutely fine.

I wonder if anybody could give me a hint what went wrong=20
and how could i fix this.

Many thanks=20
