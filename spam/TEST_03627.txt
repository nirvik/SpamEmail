I expect you to dislike KDE 4, as it does not suit your needs! That is
quite why I ask what your problems are, so that I might fix them. I
have never disputed your reasons, rather, I agree that your reasons
are valid and are cause for concern. The only thing that I disagreed
with you was on default settings of composting, and even in that
context I offered to personally design a KDE default configuration for
you that you could have composting disabled  before loading KDE for
the first time. Rude? Unpleasant? I bend over backwards to help you.

I clearly stated that my intention is not to try to convince you to
use KDE 4, rather, that my intention is to learn about the problems
that you have with KDE 4 so that I might fix them. You don't have to
help me fix KDE 4, but it is only to your own benefit to do so.
Contributors of what other software have asked you personally about
your problems with the software?

No problem, I won't help you any more. You never expressed your desire
that I might not communicate with you, other than complaining that I
do. I get the point, don't worry, I won't ask you about KDE 4 any
more.
