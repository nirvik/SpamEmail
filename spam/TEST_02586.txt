Re: ALSA (almost) made easyThanks for this, I'm going to give them another try.  One question: How
do I switch between digital out and analog out with ALSA?  With
emu10k1-tools it's easy enough (emu-config -d for digital, emu-config -a
for analog)  Is there a similar method with ALSA?

Sub : Finding out files larger than given size       LOST #324

To find out all files in a dir over a given size, try:
find /path/to/dir_of_file -type f -size +Nk
[Where N is a number like 1024 for 1mb, and multiples thereof]
