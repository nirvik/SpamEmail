Hmm . . . to someone not more familiar with Debian practices, the new
version seems more confusing. I would read that and think that Sid is
very secure because it always has the latest security fixes.  If that's
not what we mean, then perhaps the current version needs only slight
revision for clarity, e.g.,

Now:
If "sid" is used in the above example instead of "lenny", the "deb:
http://security.debian.org/ =E2=80=A6" line for security updates in the
"/etc/apt/sources.list" is not required because Sid does not receive
security updates. Security updates are only
available for stable and testing (i.e., lenny and squeeze).
