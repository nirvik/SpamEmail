Re: Java Web Start Offline ProblemsThese all appear to be Oracle bugs (i.e. not Mac OS X specific), so =
here's a quick summary of what I've found and I won't post here again on =
this subject:

1) The fix for bug 6911785 in 1.6.0_20 does seem to prevent the endless =
"hang" on launch (with an active TCP/IP connection but no internet =
access), but there are still lots of problems.

2) Launching without internet access can take between 20s and 2 minutes =
based on our few tests.

3) Launching offline results in a non-sensical "this application has =
requested to go online" dialog.

4) The JNLPClassLoader ends up doing DNS lookups which occasionally =
cause long delays during execution (e.g. 20s "freeze").

There is a new bug: =
http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=3D6931553 bug I think =
it only addresses part of the problem.=
