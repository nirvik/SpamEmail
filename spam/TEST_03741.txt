Mmmm... is that "9400 GT"? If yes, maybe the stock nvidia kernel module 
available in Lenny may work.

I've got installed "173.14" from debian repos and AFAIK, nvidia driver 
(173.08) at least supported that card (9400 GT).

That's annoying :-(

I would first try with "nv" driver (no 3D accel) to discard the freeze 
coming from another source. If using "nv" driver and you get no more 
freezes, then you can safely blame the nvidia driver and try by searching 
your same issue in the usual way:

Another option could be trying with an older nvidia driver (from their 
website) as newer nvidia drivers may have glitches with older xorg 
relases.

P.S. I am not seeing any relevant error (EE) or warning (WW) message in 
the provided Xorg log file.
