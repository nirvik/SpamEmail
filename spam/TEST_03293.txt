 Antefacto Embedded Linux...did.

 Nice little distro that'd run on a 64MB flash card (with 12MB free), with
a read-only root filesystem. Perfect for little embedded systems. It was a
very cut down version of RedHat 7.2.

 Must see can we release the build system & everything. That was the
interesting bit. Distros, in general, are a waste of time. You've no idea
how much better something like Debian or RedHat could be than something
you did yourself, unless you picked a niche area.
