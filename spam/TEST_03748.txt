I had to take a stab at answering that for a paying customer yesterday.
I _think_ you need to install postgreql-odbc and its' dependencies. Then
probably a bit of configuration to open a port to the network. But
Matthias is right, this is not the right place for this question.

To bring things back on topic, I was practicing my "rpmbuild'n skillz"
and made an rpm with some simple software tools to drive my DVD+RW
burner. No GUI frontend, but it works just fine from the command line. I
even used it to burn a bootable DVD version of Red Hat 7.3.
