Hi David,
Thanks for the response.

They may have a website, but they don't respond to email, so I don't  
know if they are still active or not.
I've tried contacting them directly myself various times and I've  
referred people to their website.
If there are any representatives from LCG here, and if they'd like to  
be listed over at AppleUsers.org, then please contact me.

TasMac, as they were known, are actually the group that recently  
folded :( and prompted my call for more groups



Also, others have suggested off list that I look at http://www.apple.com/au/usergroups/
Unfortunately that list has a couple of groups that aren't currently  
active :(
