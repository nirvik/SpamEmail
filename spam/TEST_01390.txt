Clarion comes to Australia!URL: http://boingboing.net/#85514221
Date: Not supplied

The legendary Clarion Writers' Workshop -- of which I am an alumnus, class of 
'92 -- has spun out another satellite branch (Clarion West, in Seattle, has 
been going for some years now). The new workshop, Clarion South, will be held 
in Queensland, Australia, in 2004, so that antipodeans can also attend 
science-fiction bootcamp without travelling to America. Link[1] Discuss[2] (_
Thanks, Pat!_)
