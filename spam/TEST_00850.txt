Re: Fees vs No Fees (was Re: AUGD: Free Ride for Board Members?)We get everything donated, thus don't need fees.  Space, doorprizes,
web hosting, web design, podcasting, speakers, etc.  We run it like a
traditional non-profit with a board that brings one of three things:
time, treasure, or talent.

We have a tip jar to cover minor costs such as occasional copying and
if you chip in $10 we give you a permanent name tag.
