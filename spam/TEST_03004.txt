Mmmm, that article says something about "env" variables:

***
Environment Variables

Make sure that LID_LIBRARY_PATH points to the location for libcups and 
also CUPS lp and lpr are in PATH.

When you invoke the print dialog using Control+P, all the printers 
configured show up in the Printer Name dropdown.

I'm not sure how to check this in Debian, maybe someone else can give you 
a hint on this :-)
