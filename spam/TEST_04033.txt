Better yet, let the GA figure out the correct score. ;-) That will obviously
take awhile since you'll have to acquire enough messages with it, but it
should give you a good idea if the presence of Habeus headers are good spam
indicators or not.  If they are, my guess is that Habeus will probably not
succeed.

Taking things further off-topic: Does Habeus charge a license fee to
organizations who want to use their copyrighted material or is their sole
revenue stream to come from legal judgements?  On the one hand, if they
charge license fees, I'd worry that when times got tough they'd be somewhat
less critical of organizations we'd call spammers today in order to generate
license fees.  If not, I'd worry the pendulum would swing the other way and
they'd go after legitimate businesses in an attempt to generate more
revenues from judgements and/or out of court settlements.  Either way, it
seems like they have an interesting tightrope to walk.
