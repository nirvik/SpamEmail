As Ron already said, review your system specs. 

OOo needs a lot of ram the first time it opens, and keeps consuming a 
good quantity of your system resources as long as is loaded.

In OOo 2.4 there is a "quick launch" option that preloads OOo at startup, 
not sure if that is available on newer releases.

Another thing you can try is launching OOo with an empty profile folder 
(just rename the current one) to start it from scratch and check if the 
delay still continues.
