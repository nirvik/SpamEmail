No more spell-checkHi,

my exmh-2.5 suddenly will not spell-check anymore. If I click More..., Spell...
a window opens and is gone just as fast.

I don't recall having tinkered with anything.

How can I get spell-checking back?

If you explain please do it so a standard PC user will understand.

Thanks in advance!
