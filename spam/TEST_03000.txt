<script>For Heaven's sake! he cried, let's sneak in the back way somewhere! Oh Lordy!--what a sight I am to meet your father! You saw the lights, didn't you, boys? he said.  Perhaps she means to kill him, she ran on in a blood-curdling tone. Wouldn't it be like Mr. Wharton to be stabbed to the heart on the steps of a church, just as his great work was done? Do you know I think he would like it. He is dying to be tragic like the Venetians, and have some one write a poem about him. Then after a moment's pause, she added, in the same indifferent tone of voice: All the same, if he's not there, I mean to go back and look out for him. I'm not going to let that woman kill him if I can help it! </script>
