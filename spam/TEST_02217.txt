I have not experienced this specific problem, but yesterday I installed gpm
(General Purpose Mouse) in the course of fixing another problem, and I
noticed that among its command line options there is:

    -r number
           Set  the responsiveness as a percentage of motion (1 to 100, def=
ault
           10). A lower number can be used to slow down cursor motion, this=
 can
           not be used to make a mouse move faster, see =E2=80=98-a=E2=80=
=99.

I am now running the mouse in KDE via gpm as described in my message
http://lists.debian.org/debian-user/2010/05/msg01389.html
and at the end of the FAQ entry
http://wiki.debian.org/XStrikeForce/FAQ#lefthandmouse

Experimenting with gpm yesterday and today, it does not seem to respond to
command line instructions, only to what is in /etc/gpm.conf.

Best regards,
Chris Austin.
