Thanks for the reply, but first of all, I do not think it's the kernel 
at fault, it's some library upgrade (imho); second, no broken deps;
third, it was 2.6.34 vanilla; finally, fourth, I know what to expect 
from a sid/testing system; I just wanted to inform so I can help
getting rid of this bug. And, btw, XFCE works ok, although being also 
GTK-based.
