That does not look correct.  Just to see how it works, I just chaged the
netmask of my pc from /24 to /16, it is working
router - 192.168.1.1/255.255.255.0
pc1 - 192.168.1.50/255.255.0.0, gw 192.168.1.1, broadcast 192.168.255.255
This pc1 could reach all other machines on 192.168.1.0/24 network with the
above configuration, also it could access internet using 192.168.1.1 as the
gateway.

In your example, network 192.168.11.55/22 (netmask 255.255.252.0) means
192.168.8.0 to 192.168.11.255.  It could very well reach 192.168.11.1.  But
on the other hand 192.168.11.1/24 could reach only 192.168.11.0 to
192.168.11.255 machines.
