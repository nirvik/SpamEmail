[Razor-users] Razor 2.14 - the day afterI recently installed Razor v2.14 and started using it.  I am finding it
necessary to whitelist a _lot_ of mailing lists.  Some, such as yahoogroups,
I can't whitelist because the from: address is the person making the post,
so I will have to whitelist on another field when I can modify my code to do
so.  I wonder if someone is not being careful about their submissions, or if
these are bad mailing lists that don't drop bad mail addresses that become
trollboxes in time.

Any employee who has left my company more than three years ago is eligible
to become a trollbox.  I figure after three years of bounced mail, the list
should have figured out they aren't here any more.
