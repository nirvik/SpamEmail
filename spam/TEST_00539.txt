Funny, I was in the middle of composing the same message when I saw yours.

It would be nice if it sees a header like:
Content-type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1

and defang_mime is 0, it could wrap the report with <pre></pre> for ease
of reading?

And the same sort of problem seems to occur with base64 encoded messages.
The report is placed inside of the mime boundary:
------=_NextPart_000_00B7_31E64A2B.B8441E37
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64

SPAM: -------------------- Start SpamAssassin results ----------------------

Should this not go above (probably in it's own mime section,) to make sure
that the attachments don't get destroyed?
