RE: Jobs: Thoughts on JavaHmmm, my wife has an iPhone and I have a Motorola Milestone (android) =
and my phone's UI seems neither slow nor sucky in comparison. In =
particular the gmail integration seems much better on my phone than the =
iPhone.

Anyway, I don't think Jobs could pen the same type of missive about Java =
that he did about Flash.

I still think Java development in Eclipse is more productive than =
Objective-C development in X-Code - and my Java apps run on Windows and =
Linux as well.

Cheers, Eric

I take it you've never played with android? Or a blackberry? They're
kind of slow and sucky ui wise.
