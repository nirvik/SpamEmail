JavaFrameEmbedding questionI'm rather interested in embedding a JPanel into a Cocoa GUI.  The =
JavaFrameEmbedding class looks promising and the JavaMapping example =
seem interesting at first, but then doesn't seem to show enough of how =
to pull it off when an existing app is already invoking a jvm. =20

Does anyone have any experience with embedding Swing into Cocoa?  Or, =
embedding SWT into Cocoa would also work if anyone has experience with =
that..
