PKI smartcard/CA/profile/email/software interoperability, (real) standards, patentsHas anyone had much positive experience with PKI based smartcards, email 
(S/Mime interoperability), programming to smart cards, etc.?

One area in particular that seems surprising is that a number of 
projects are using cards like the Datakey 330 which seems to store data 
in a way that is proprietary to particular card/reader driver versions.

I've been told, on the other hand, that Java PKI smart cards are very 
interchangable and upward compatible.  The only reasons I've been able 
to find so far for using the more 'proprietary' cards is that they may 
be cheaper and further along in FIPS validation.
