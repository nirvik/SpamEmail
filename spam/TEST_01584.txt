help resizing a partition on GPT diskHi

I have built a 5T partition with my raid card and just expanded it out
to 9G, now I want to resize the partition I had to use parted so that
I can use gpt partitions. Every time I go to resize partd tells me it
doesn't know what fs ison the partition - its a pv.  so I am sort of
stuck ...


Never really used gpt before.

Thanks
Alex
