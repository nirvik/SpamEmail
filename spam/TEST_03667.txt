[SAtalk] "Broken Pipe" on initial testHi

I've just installed SpamAssassin and relevant modules.
Just tried the initial test: 

spamassassin -t < sample-nonspam.txt > nonspam.out

and got back:

Broken Pipe

I've also tried using the -P and --pipe option but to
no avail.

Any help greatly appreciated. BTW - I'm no great Perl
expert!
