That doesn't seem right.  I have been using reiser3 since 2005, and my syst=
em=20
does not require a journal replay if I do a clean shutdown/reboot.  A force=
d=20
reboot through Alt+SysRq+B does trigger a journal replay (as it should).

I also have 4+ tebibytes but most of them are allocated to filesystems.  I'=
ve=20
had to shrink filesystems dozens of times since 2005, during or after a dat=
a=20
move.

I don't use partitions (much), having been using LVM happily for everything=
=20
except /boot.  I'm hoping to be able to move that onto LVM once I move to=20
GRUB2 and GPT.

btrfs is included in 2.6.31.12-0.2-default in openSUSE 11.2.  It is also=20
included in linux-image-2.6-686 and linux-image-2.6-amd64 for lenny-backpor=
ts,=20
testing, and sid.  I don't normally deal with other=20
architectures/distributions, so it might also be available there.

It doesn't appear to be a file system issue, but rather a problem with the=
=20
initramfs scripts.  It could also be rooted in my configuration.  I know th=
at=20
my "root=3D" kernel parameter has to differ from the device name in my=20
/etc/fstab in order to get the initramfs to correctly initialize LVM.

I don't mind being a first adopter for this in particular; I hope to be abl=
e=20
to report good things about btrfs by this time next year.
