  That ldd can't see it is just weird.

  Is the directory NFS-mounted?  I have sometimes seen NFS mounts get
confused and do stuff like this, with files showing up in some
queries but not others.  Changing the NFS export or mount options
to more careful settings can help (e.g. use "sync", turn off caching, etc.)

  Alternatively, I recall that if a file-system is mounted "noexec", it
can give confusing messages when you try to run things from it -- I think
it's usually "permission denied", but maybe my recollection is faulty?

  Other than that, given the evidence in the rest of the thread, I'm 
going to guess that it's some kind of file-system error.  Check the 
logs (especially /var/log/kern.log) for errors, maybe fsck the 
filesystem, and try again...
