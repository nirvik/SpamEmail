Really?  I was under the impression that laptops and netbooks are now the
primary computer of well over 50% of users worldwide (not counting smart
phones).  Laptops have a built-in UPS.  In the U.S., given the numbers of
cheap APC, Triplite, and Belkin UPS on the shelves at $big_box_store I'd say
most U.S. desktop users have a UPS.  I know I do.  Pretty much every
computer user I know personally has a UPS.  In other parts of the world I'm
sure there are many people who can barely afford a PC let alone a UPS.  Used
laptops are a great fit for those users, assuming the batteries aren't shot.

Don't read me wrong.  I'm not advocating XFS on laptops, although I do know
of many folks who use it on laptops.  For the average user there would be
little performance benefit.  For power users it's a valid possible choice.
