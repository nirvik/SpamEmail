Strange. If you haved tested with several video file containers (video 
formats), different audio/video codecs and also using different video 
players and all of them behaves in the same manner... I would suspect 
about the performance of video card.

Yes, but not all video cards perform good when playing HD (or HD ready) 
videos. For instance, Intel cards (the ones you can find embedded into 
the majority of netbooks) are not the most suitable for high quality 
video streaming/playing :-)

O.k.

Which codecs do you find to be problematic? :-? 

Try with several video files using different video codecs and make some 
performance tests.

Note that every video player uses its own set of codecs (VLC and MPlayer 
at least, Totem maybe uses system-wide a/v installed codecs) so 
performance may vary between them. 

One more question, though... how about a DVD video? It renders the 
same? :-?
