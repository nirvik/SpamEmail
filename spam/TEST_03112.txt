You were only talking about running 'make-kpkg clean'.

Does v.12.033 always run a 'clean' first? Mine with lenny v.11.015 does
not. If not, I suggest: make-kpkg clean &>/dev/null && make-kpkg
--your-build-options
You want to see the output of the build, but the clean process is too
much? The build output will be multiple times greater anyways. This is
not a problem over the slow link?

Yep, we figure - thus try to work-around ...
