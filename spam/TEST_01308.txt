Placing icons on bottom bar.I have the Debian variant Knoppix installed on my laptop. Now I want to 
move some icons to the bottom bar and have them stay there between 
sessions. I know how to do this with various versions of Slackware using 
KDE 3.5 and XFCE but I am a newcomer to the world of Debian.

Anyone have any hints?
