Ah, that makes more sense to me :-)

Well, it seems you have 3 physical hard disks, with windows installed in 
the first partition of the IDE hdd and Lenny in the second SATA (500 GiB).

First you have to do is *to know* what hard disk is being booted in first 
place by the BIOS ("IDE 80" -windows- or "SATA 500" -lenny-). After that, 
put here the results of your findings and we will see what could be the 
better setup for installing GRUB :-)
