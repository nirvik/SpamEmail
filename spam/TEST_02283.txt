 From the symptoms you describe, and ruling out bad RAM (you HAVE of =20
course checked for bad RAM, haven't you?), my first guess would be "an =20
aging optical drive, combined with a flakily burnt CD". Such =20
combinations can prove hard to overcome. Suggestions: temporarily =20
installing a newer optical drive into the box; or burning another CD, =20
preferably on a different drive/machine, and on different brand of =20
media, and at the slowest burning rate available; or perhaps, for the =20
adventurous at heart, even asking uncle Google about "installing Debian =20
directly from an ISO file on the hard drive, without burning a CD".
