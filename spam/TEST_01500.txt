Bomber targets Dutch Ikea stores

Police in the Netherlands are searching all 10 outlets of the Ikea furniture
chain in the country, after finding bombs in two stores.
The devices were discovered in Amsterdam and Sliedrecht, near the port city
of Rotterdam on Tuesday evening.
The Sliedrecht bomb exploded at a police station, injuring two policeman.
Police have also closed off a motorway section in the central city Utrecht,
near a third IKEA store where a suspicious package was found.
No information about the motive behind the attacks has been released.
"We decided together with the police because of safety reasons that the
company's stores in the Netherlands would be closed today," said Ikea
spokeswoman Helen van Trearum.
"We don't want to take any risks. We are taking this very seriously," she
added.
Ikea - a Swedish-based group - is one of the world's largest furniture
retailers, with stores in more than 30 countries.
Meanwhile, the Amsterdam head office of the Dutch news agency ANP was
evacuated on Wednesday, after police warned that a bomb might have been
planted in the building.
