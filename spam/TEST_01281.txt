It doesn't need to as Red Hat Linux already sets correct permissions on all
ALSA audio devices for locally logged in users (through the console.perms
file) and the modules.conf files takes care of loading the right modules on
demand. Also, aumix and the scripts that come with Red Hat Linux still work
for controlling the volume, so it's still saved and restored when the
computer is halted, even using ALSA.

I'm glad you got your card working with these! I'm now wondering if I won't
maybe buy an amplifier that supports Dolby Digial decoding (my current one
"only" does PRo Logic) since I've read that ALSA supports the S/PDIF
optical output of the sound chip of my Shuttle!

>>From what I can tell after only 2 days using it : ALSA rocks, especially
since having a full OSS compatibility results that it breaks nothing at
all! :-)
