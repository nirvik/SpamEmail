thank you, camaleón.

i replaced already the  "nvidia"-driver with "nv" and the 
freezing-problem disappeared complaetely (so: no hardware problem)  but 
kaffeine behaves funny on .avi and or .mpeg4 files &&. that is, i think, 
because of the fact that i use (just to try out) the upstart-file that 
the sgfxi script made in my X11 file (the last time i installed the 
latest nvidia-driver out of /usr/local/bin with the sgfxi-script. very 
convenient!

now i gonna follow your advice and put back my native debian xorg.conf 
into X11 and put your 'section-advice' in it and see what hasppens, 
especially with kaffeine (and gmplayer, svn variant)

thank you very much and also thanks for everybody who took time to 
answer to my problem;

i'll let you know what happens

many regards,

steef
