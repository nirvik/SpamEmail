Note that I since got rid of bayes.ini (it's embedded in Options.py 
now), so search-path issues won't burn you here anymore.  The intended 
way to customize the tokenizer and testers is via creating your own 
bayescustomize.ini.  You'll get burned by search-path issues wrt that 
instead now <0.7 wink>.
