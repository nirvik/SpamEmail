Fine - nobody can oblige SuSE to do anything other
than put up the ftp version, but surely they
can't prevent a CD owner from burning a copy and
giving it to me?

What is the GPL all about then?

But *_surely_* they cannot BSD Linux? It's not
theirs to BSD!

Nobody can oblige them to give away anything
other than ftp - I'm not asking for that. I'm
asking for somebody who has Linux (GPL'ed) to
burn a copy for me and give it to me in exchange
for a reasonable consideration (say, the price of
the CDs and a bottle of Frascati or a couple of
pints?).


What does the GPL mean now?


I don't want their 60 days of free email support
or anything similar (if I did, I would pay for
it).
