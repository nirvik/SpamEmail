traceback in new exmhI just updated to the latest CVS - I had been running a build from June.  
Hitting the Flist button gives the following traceback:

syntax error in expression "int(17+1+(222-)*(19-17-2)/(224-))"
    while executing
"expr int($minLine+1+($msgid-$minMsg)*($maxLine-$minLine-2)/($maxMsg-$minMsg))"
    (procedure "Ftoc_FindMsg" line 57)
    invoked from within
"Ftoc_FindMsg $i"
    (procedure "Ftoc_ShowSequences" line 16)
    invoked from within
"Ftoc_ShowSequences $F"
    (procedure "ScanFolder" line 81)
    invoked from within

    invoked from within

    (procedure "Scan_Folder" line 2)
    invoked from within

    (procedure "Inc_PresortFinish" line 7)
    invoked from within

    invoked from within
".fops.flist invoke"
    ("uplevel" body line 1)
    invoked from within
"uplevel #0 [list $w invoke]"
    (procedure "tkButtonUp" line 7)
    invoked from within
"tkButtonUp .fops.flist
"
    (command bound to event)


It seems to only happen in a folder with no unseen messages.

Chris, is this related to your recent changes?
