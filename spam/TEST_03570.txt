 Bind configs are one sort of file.

 I think the person asking Kevin the question would like to have a nice
config language like:

 domain: "bing.com"
 hosts:  www mail arse smeg twitter
 ttl:    20000

 and then using lex & yacc, they could write a program that converts
between that config file, and the tedious bind configs, and maybe even
auto-generate a reverse DNS config file while they are at it.

 Personally, I think they are demented. It's much more a job for something
simple like Sed or Awk. People using lex & yacc just because they can make
baby jesus cry.
