How is this measured?

You do not dicuss problems. You just repeat and repeat
and repeat that KDE 4 is wrong and the devs are wrong
and that KDE 3 is better.

Oh, have you already been to the Apache folks telling them,
Apache 1.3 was better and they should package it instead of
the very very wrong Apache 2?

I think the reaction will be the same in almost every project.

If you were able to convince the KDE packagers to re-package
KDE 3.5, it would be a bad day for KDE 4, so yes, we (as in
the ones who like to see KDE 4 grow up) care.

Who decides what is "useful"?
It us udeful for KDE if everybody would just focus on improving
KDE 4 instead if digging up corpses.

Anyway, good luck. Maybe you should try contacting the ones that
are still working on KDE 3 (Trinity, vectorlinux, ...) and move
this discussion there.
