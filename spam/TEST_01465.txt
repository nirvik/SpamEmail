Just one more info. I measured the time spent wrapping the stuff in 
Ftoc_Next with time {} so the data is for real. One difference 
between mine and Valdis' setup (judging from his trace) is that I use 
the address book. I've been doing that for ages so that can't be the 
problem.

Is there a way to get the log to print time with higher granularity?
