  That's not quite right.

  The default version is the highest-priority available version.  It
just happens that setting the pin priority to 990 *normally* has the
effect of changing the default version, but you could theoretically
manually pin another version to be higher.

  The second effect of Default-Release is to change how certain
aptitude / apt-get commands choose the target version.  This includes
"apt-get source", "apt-get build-dep", "aptitude build-dep", "aptitude
changelog", "aptitude download", and "aptitude show".  In aptitude,
it causes arguments with no archive or version specifier to be treated
as if "/default-release" had been included.  Unfortunately, it's
dreadfully underdocumented and underspecified.
