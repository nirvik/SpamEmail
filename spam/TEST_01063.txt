RE: [ILUG] Dell GX260 V Redhat 7.3
When I get a box I don't want any of that integrated chipset crap 
whether its for winblows or linux. Its just like IBM (mwave dsp chip ?)
(shared video/main memory ?)in the old days. I know you can flip a 
mboard jumper switch to turn crap off and install your own cards 
but why bother ?

To clarify my point is this ....
Dell makes excellent machines and I would recomend their machines and 
their aftersales support over any other manufacturer that I can think of.
However if you want that box for linux and you have a life and you dont
want to spend a week of it fucking arround and googling to get that box
working properly be damned sure you do your research before you buy it.
And this especially applies to their budget machines.

And this isn't taking a swing at you John but ...

>>Just a bad thing for those that hope a distro will work out of

A lot of the time the reason that you encounter this is cause someone has 
such a box and they say to you "hey can you install that linux code that I
got
from the guy in the internet cafe" :-) and you say sure and you go to their
house 
(without a net connection/56k modem). And the machine has got this crap
windoze
only hardware and eventually you shrug in frustration and they say 
"well I didn't expect much from something thats free anyhow"

When Dell were squabbling with Windows and it looked as though there might
be 
a Dell/Redhat alliance my Inspiron 4000 was produced ... it worked a treat,
now that dell doesn't give a shit about linux all their new cheap boxes are
linux 
incompatable in small ways.

 Buying any new machine is going to cause problems with a six month old
set of drivers. Same happens in windows - you have to go get your drivers.

 Yes, dell use the most recent stuff they can, to save money. That's not a
bad thing. Just a bad thing for those that hope a distro will work out of
the box.
