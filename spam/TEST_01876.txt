QuickTime chatty on multicasts?I'm doing Real and Windows Media multicast streams. Mac users are using Rea=
lPlayer for the Real, and a rollover unicast from the Windows server with a=
 QuickTime plugin using Flip4Mac.

Looking at the multicast traffic, we're seeing a lot of RTCP packets coming=
 from Mac boxes to the unicast address of the Real streams. It seems this h=
appens when QuickTime Player is launched and they view or have viewed the R=
eal stream?

The problem is that it means there are lots of sources advertising themselv=
es as the "source" for that multicast address.

Is this an expected outcome? Anyone recognize what I'm seeing?=20

I saw the packets from my own system, and they quit when I quit QTP 7, star=
ted back when I relaunched it. I'm running snow leopard, most users aren't =
yet.
