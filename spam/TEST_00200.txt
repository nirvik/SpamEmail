Whether Akonadi works or not appears to be a game of roulette to me.=20
=46reshly since upgrading from KDE 4.4.3:

Bug 236535 -  sometimes can't open and log timezone and privilege tables
https://bugs.kde.org/236535

Bug 236538 -  often does not find resource agents on first start of Kontact
https://bugs.kde.org/236538

Bug 236539 -  dbus session bus not available on first start of Kontact -=20
race condition?
https://bugs.kde.org/236539

I already grepped in ~/.local/share/contacts for contact information as=20
Akonadi was not available and I didn't now it would be there when I start=20
kontact again.

My address book as to be accessible *all of the time* without bombarding=20
me with more and less cryptic error messages. There are about 15 self=20
tests that might fail. I think Akonadi from KDE 4.4 depends on too many=20
external factors that it just can't control fully.

But nonetheless: I think these issues should be fixed upstream. And I also=
=20
don't what else Debian developers could do then to use KDEPIM from KDE 4.4=
=20
if the freeze will really happen this summer. Shipping KDEPIM 4.3 with KDE=
=20
4.4 might not be an option for Debian KDE developers, cause it abandoned=20
by upstream already and all security fixes needs to be backported. Sure=20
when KDE 4.5 is out the same happens to KDE 4.4, but at least it will=20
contain the security and other fixes upto then.=20

So either KDE project decides to fix any Akonadi related issues for KDE 4.4=
=20
series or Debian extends freeze. Other options would be: Shipping a KDE=20
4.5 backport or even Squeeze + 1 shortly afterwards.

Ciao,
