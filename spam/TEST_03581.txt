For personal use i prefer Debian, i really dislike the sudo approach
and all the pampering (as dislike big desktop environments regardless
of my =C3=BCber hardware). Wanting to look under the hood is why i tried
Linux in the first place (some old redhat i didn't like).

Distros like Ubuntu are good in that they are much more end-user
friendly and are good advertising tools -  provided the issues Andrei
Popescu mentioned are dealt with; as people already stated, end-users
don't care about open source or GPL or the evil Mr Gates, they want
stuff that Just Works=E2=84=A2. As long as the user is willing to tolerate =
a
slight aesthetic change, it's a go. However, the more these distros
become "windows-ised" the more i get this eerie feeling i can't quite
name, maybe history repeating?
