In academic interest you can look what LS_COLORS environment variable contain:

$ echo $LS_COLORS

After that you can look what's wrong with it.

Fix is pretty easy:

$ eval `dircolors`

Read man pages for dircolors(1) and  dir_colors(5) for most complete reference.
Note that you should place command mentioned above to .bashrc (or .zshrc, or
whatever your shell' config is) so it will run every time shell starts.
