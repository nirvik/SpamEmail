In that case there is no really meter what they have. Only you will do 
him a big favor if you put Debian because in that case they will be much 
  safer from virus's and it's much easier to open synaptic, hit refresh 
button, upgrade and apply then manually download all app. and next, 
next, next, reboot.
 From my experience it is really much easier to have Debian then Windows.
They will call you less :-)
