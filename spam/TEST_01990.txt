A quick Google search turns up:

MPEG4IP: Open Source, Open Standards, Open Streaming

MPEG4IP provides an end-to-end system to explore MPEG-4 multimedia. The
package includes many existing open source packages and the "glue" to
integrate them together. This is a tool for streaming video and audio that
is standards-oriented and free from proprietary protocols and extensions.

Provided are an MPEG-4 AAC audio encoder, an MP3 encoder, two MPEG-4 video
encoders, an MP4 file creator and hinter, an IETF standards-based streaming
server, and an MPEG-4 player that can both stream and playback from local
file.

Our development is focused on the Linux platform, and has been ported to
Windows, Solaris, FreeBSD, BSD/OS and Mac OS X, but it should be relatively
straight-forward to use on other platforms. Many of the included packages
are multi-platform already.


Both sound interesting, and low $$.
