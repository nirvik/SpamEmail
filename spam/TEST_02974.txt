It's not just krpm, the desktop HDs have a higher failure rate. But I
agree, EIDE has high density, and EIDE hardware RAID can offer SCSI a
sound beating for reliability, performance, and storage density/rack units
for the money, if designed for it, and if people would actually start 
buying it.

There are not all that many hard drives inside an 1U enclosure. Airflow
blockage (you have to fit in 2-3x the number of SCSI disks with EIDE) will
soon be a thing of the past due to SATA.

Since rack-space costs dominate, and our systems need more or less decent
I/O we're going with 1U Dells with SCSI. The hard drive prices don't
really make a visible difference, given the cost of the iron, and the
rackspace/month. Plus, 1U Dells don't have any space left for lots of EIDE
drives.
