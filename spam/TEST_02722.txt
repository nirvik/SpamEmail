[SAdev] 2.40: ready for release?OK guys -- I reckon it's now Good Enough, modulo some minor score
tweaking, or commenting of some more broken/high-FP-ing rules.

What do you all think?  are we ready to go?  anyone run into any trouble
with the new autoconf code, or found a bug from the merge of that spamc
BSMTP-support patch?

I expect there *will* be a 2.41 BTW.
