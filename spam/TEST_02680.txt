Regardless the rationale, this seems to be an attitude that has become
very pervasive among KDE developers with the advent of KDE4 and it has
me looking seriously at the alternatives.  I no longer recommend KDE to
other users due to the "my way or the highway" attitude I've encountered
since running KDE 4.2 over a year ago and encountering various issues.
