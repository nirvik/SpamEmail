[1]Perl Mongers web site. We're still going thru the process of cleaning
up the data about the Perl Monger groups, so if you see something that
isn't quite right then please [2]let us know."

It seems the older Perl gets, the more willing people are to believe that
it sucks, without any reasonable facts. [0]davorg writes "You may have
seen the article [1]Can Java technology beat Perl on its home turf with
pattern matching in large files? that there has been some debate about on
both #perl and comp.lang.perl.misc today. One of the biggest criticisms
of the article was that the author hasn't published the Perl code that he
is comparing his Java with."

This was not a very busy week, with people packing for YAPC::Europe, and
all that... Nevertheless, the smoke tests were running, the bug reports
were flying, and an appropriate amount of patches were sent. Read about
printf formats, serialized tied thingies, built-in leak testing, syntax
oddities, et alii.
