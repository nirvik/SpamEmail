Re: boycotting yahoo
I'm a bit confused about this boycott thing.  How is what China is
doing any different than having Scientology and who ever else
state-side who takes the whim evoking the DMCA to close down foreign
sites they deem inappropriate?  At least the Chinese make it voluntary
and ask politely, rather than just sending legal musclemen first off.
