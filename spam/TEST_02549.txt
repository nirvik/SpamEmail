Re: iSight - setFrameRateHi Alex,

Welcome to the joys of quicktime video.
I gave up on the sequence grabber years ago, due to similar problems.
It looks like SGIdle() is polling the camera five times, finding
a frame ready only the first time.  I believe there is no real
callback triggered by the video hardware, just this polling hack.

You can get more control by using the underlying "vdig" layer,
but this code is arcane and undocumented.  I finally got fast video
to work on a mac, after finding the "seeSaw" example of Daniel
Heckenberg, which shows how to write a video frame to an opengl texture.
I think it was his thesis (!)  This much of the vdig interface has
been implemented for the isight, and works for a lot of cameras,
thanks to the open source "macam" driver efforts.

People would probably advise you to use the newer "qtkit" layer
to access video frames.  This may just be an objective C blanket
pulled over the old code, I don't know.  I'm not changing over,
the old stuff runs well, especially on the new multiprocessor machines.

The guys who originally wrote the quicktime code may be long gone,
perhaps retired to a hot tub in the Los Altos hills.
But their morass lives on!
