hmm... with pthreads there is always one thread which acts as a 
'thread manager'. do the number of processes accumulate? or is it 
just that the # of threads is == # of threads you're expecting + 1? 
if the latter, ttbomk that is normal.

ie, you dont create the thread until the accept() returns. so up 
until then its a normal programme (ie no thread manager). after that 
you will always have +1 processes (for the thread manager).

also, the stack for further threads is allocated from the heap. (see
sigaltstack() ) possibly glibc does not brk() back the space, just
like malloc()/free() does not always release the space to the heap
again (as most programmes will allocate memory / threads again
soonish anyway).
