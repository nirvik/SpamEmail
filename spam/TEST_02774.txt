Officially no. But also on my ftp://people.redhat.com/ckloiber page is
rpms for the rar-3.00 file archiving/unarchiving program. This is
distributed as a binary tarball only, and I repackaged it based
originally on an earlier version of rar I found on the net, just for
practice. It also makes use of subpackages, and I was both proud of
myself for getting it to work, and sickened that I repackaged
binary-only crap. Enjoy.
