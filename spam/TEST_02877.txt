Computational RecreationsDoes anyone here know if the Computational Recreations columns from 
Scientific American in the 70's/80's were compiled into a book or two? I 
think I remember Martin Gardner publishing the earlier Mathematical 
Recreations in a couple of hard covers, but I'm unsure about the later 
column. Help?
