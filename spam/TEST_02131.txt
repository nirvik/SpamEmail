 I've just been re-aquainted with the Jumpstart stuff after a long
absence.

 There is a nice need 'add_install_client' script that you feed the
archtecture, ethernet address & ip to, and it'll setup everything from
RARP to Bootparams for you. Very simple.

 This script takes a -d option, to boot via DHCP also. On the negative
side, Sun's terminal handling leaves a lot to be desired - it won't work
properly on a Wyse 120+ for instance, no matter what emulation mode the
Wyse is trying to do.

 To do PC netbooting properly, you need an motherbard with a PXE BIOS.
Then you are flying.

 Heh, how hard would it be to get a PC with an OpenBoot prom ?
