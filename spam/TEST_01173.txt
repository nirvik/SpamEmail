Remember that the GA is going to be considering combinatorial 
uses of the rules, so rules which look dodgy on their own might 
be gems for the GA -- perhaps something with a S/O ratio of .5 
actually occurs often in combination with some other rule, and 
in those situations, helps to distinguish spam vs nonspam.
