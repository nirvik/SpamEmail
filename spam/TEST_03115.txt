20 NEW SIGNS THAT YOU WERE ABDUCTED BY SPACE ALIENS!

WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. -- You may have been abducted by space aliens --
and not even know it!

Psychiatrists, psychologists and UFO experts say millions of people
all over the world have been kidnapped by extraterrestrials. But most
of them can't recall the experience because the memory is so painful
that they've buried it deep in their subconscious minds.

But there are strong tip-offs that you may be one of the millions who
have encountered beings from another planet, if you know what to watch
for.

Experts at Wake Forest University here, as well as other respected
institutions around the world, offer 20 startling new indicators that
you may have had a close encounter:

1. You experience unexplained nausea or a strange sense of uneasiness
around the same time each day.

2. You have an unusual new scar or strange mark on your body --
particularly on the roof of your mouth or behind an ear.

3. You often find yourself hungry for oranges or lemons -- even after
you've had a large meal or eaten enough food to fill your
stomach. Researchers at Oslo University say this hunger for citrus is
common in alien abductees.

4. You have a strong, ever-present feeling that there is some mission
or important thing you're supposed to do in life and you find yourself
constantly driven to achieve it or discover what it might be.

5. You often find yourself going through your trash, or the trash of
others, without knowing exactly what you're looking for. Swiss UFO
researchers found that people who have been abducted often find
themselves unaccountably digging through refuse.

6. You frequently dream of cattle. Psychologists at the University of
Paris say it's common for the subconscious mind to substitute a cow or
bull for an alien being.

7. You feel you're "special" or "chosen."

8. You are a vegetarian -- but can't exactly explain why.

9. You have an overpowering feeling of dread when you see photos or
drawings of space aliens.

10. You are prone to addictive or compulsive behavior. This in itself
is not necessarily indicative of alien abduction. But if there are
other indicators as well, you could be an abductee.

11. You wet the bed. Studies in Peru show there's a connection.

12. You have frequent insomnia.

13. You are strangely intrigued by old western movies. Psychologists
say they can't yet explain abductees' fascination with cowboy movies,
but they say it exists in at least 75 percent of victims.

14. Electronic devices often go haywire around you for no discernible
reason.

15. You have seen -- or think you've seen -- a mysterious, hooded
figure in or near your home more than once.

16. Your fingers are stiff, numb or unresponsive for more than an hour
after you wake up.

17. You have had -- or currently have -- severe back or neck problems.

18. You frequently experience a ringing in one ear.

19. You often get sinusitis or other nasal pain.

20. You are frequently haunted by the sense that you're being watched.
