I think we need to get away from rhetoric that implies that the 
billions of dollars in hard cash, revenues, and capitalization was 
"lost" somehow.

The ruling class, whether you define them as government or business 
(what's the difference?) knows full well where that money is.  It's 
lining their pockets, buying their hobby ranches, and financing 
their private jets.

Neither has any interest in the welfare of the working class.

Of course, none of this is new bits.
