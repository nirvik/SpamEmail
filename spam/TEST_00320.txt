Re: [Razor-users] What's wrong with the Razor servers now?Hi,

We were rolling out changes to TeS and catalogue servers over the last two
days. Any glitches you might have experienced would have been due to the
upgrades. The upgrades are now complete, and things are back to normal.
Several new features in TeS will provide better accuracy, specially with
regards to false-positives.

cheers,
vipul.
