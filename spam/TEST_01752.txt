Are you sure that this is currently required?  From the changelog:

kernel-package (12.016) unstable; urgency=low

  * [4df65e7]: Remove obsolete warnings about running make-clean
    With the new facility to regenerate ./debian, all the old strictures
    about running make clean after anything that might change the version
    number have beenmade obsolete, so remove from man page.  
    Bug fix: "Is the --append-to-version section still accurate?", thanks
    to Frédéric Brière. Short answer: No.                  (Closes: #534743).
