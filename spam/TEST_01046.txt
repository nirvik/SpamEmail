I've noticed the same things. I've stuck with epiphany because it worked
so well for so long but there are times recently when I need to use
iceweasel. I think it's the switch from the gecko backend to webkit that
broke a lot of things that used to work well.

I keep hoping that these problems can be resolved but time will tell. I
use unstable and downloading works fine but java apps that use the
plugin still don't work.
