normally as a part during reboot/shutdown procedure, sigterm is sent
to all processes.  This causes processes to terminate during which file
descriptors are closed down flushing their cache.  This is written to disk
during filesytem sync.
So these files are preserved.  But when the system goes down because of a
power glitch, there are chances that you lose your data from last filesystem
sync.
