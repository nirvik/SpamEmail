I have a HP mini and a HP 8530w netbook and laptop.

I love the netbook for easy work any were  (work => mail, web, reading
word or pdf) for serious stuff I use laptop.  If need by rdp from
netbook to my server (or from the laptop to server).

The netbook is great - inbuild 3g _ 802.11n and 1g eth.  Battery works
well for me. I package to carry around small and lite
