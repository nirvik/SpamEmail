Creating a debian local mirror from 5 debian DVDsHi all,
I want to do mass network installation using pxe boot and using a local
debian mirror. However I don't want to download the files from a debian
mirror to create a local one? Is it possible to create a mirror using
the 5 DVDs of debian that I have? I tried using the option
'debian-installer/allow_unauthenticated=true' in pxelinux.cfg/default
file, but I get a 'bad archive mirror' error. How to work around this
problem?

Thank you.

Regards,
Guruprasad
