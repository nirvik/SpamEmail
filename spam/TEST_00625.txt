nvidia legacy driver//kernel 2.6.32 issuesFollowing "apt-get dist-upgrade" with debian squeeze i386, upgrading
from kernel 2.6.30 to 2.6.32, the xserver was broken at "startx"
because kernel compiled with gcc 4.3 while now gcc 4.4. I could only
boot from previous 2.6.30 to have the xserver at startx.

Following

export CC=/usr/bin/gcc-4.3

I reinstalled the nvidia driver "NVIDIA-Linux-x86-96.43.16-pk1.run"
for my "GeForce2 MX200 (rev b2)", the driver installed correctly and
was reconfigured correctly according to the nvidia installer messages,
though, again, it works for 2.6.30, not for 2.6.32. Please see below
the relevant portion of /var/log/Xorg.0.log:

With previous 2.6.30 I used successfully either the debian way or the
nvidia installer (actually, I remained at the nvidia installer
installation of the driver). Now I am using the 2.6.30 kernel with the
installation for 2.6.32, which is too bad.

thanks
