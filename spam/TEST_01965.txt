 ARRGGGHHHH!!!!!
 profuse apologies, the wrong version of my reply was posted
 (blame it on being late for the pub).  ;-(

 the above is almost pure B*S* --- I got my `tar's and `cpio's
 confused.  what I said _is_ correct, but for cpio(1) archives;
 tar(1) archives do _not_ replicate the data for hard links.

 I spotted this confusion on my part before I posted my reply,
 and re-wrote it to be more correct, yet somehow the wrong
 version got sent anyways.  ARRGGGHHHH!!!!!  ;-(  ;-(  ;-(

 anyways, GNU `cpio -p' does not do spurious reads or writes.
 GNU `tar cf - ... | tar xf - ...' also does not, albeit each
 `tar' both reads and writes the data.  hence, there is twice
 (not thrice!) the I/O of `cpio -p', maybe an issue for c.60Gb.

 using strace(1), I've verified my claim GNU `cpio -p' does
 not do spurious reads or writes, i.e. it link(2)s.  but having
 just come back from the pub, perhaps this should also be taken
 with extra skepticism ......   ;-\ 

sorry.  cheers!
