Well, the one thing that seemed quite odd to me is that you appear to be =
doing all the work in the Constructor of your class.  I would be leery =
of doing anything like that.  I don't know if that is the cause of the =
problem, but I would try moving the actual testing you want out into a =
separate method and then doing something like

   Robot1 r =3D new Robot1();
   r.doTest();

in your main method.
