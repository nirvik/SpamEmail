James,
Last week, when indexing stuff for WhoisIreland.com, I noticed that
ns0.domainregistry.ie and banba.domainregistry.ie were out of synch by a
few days. The other nameservers seemed to give a current SOA at that
time. However the affected secondaries may have been using
ns0.domainregistry.ie for axfr and propagated the error.

This whole thing does seriously bring into question IEDR's decision to
outsource the technical admininstration of .ie to a company that
apparently does not even admin its own DNS.  It is a nice story though -
almost as good as the time that .ie disappeared for 8 hours in July
1998.

Regards...jmcc
