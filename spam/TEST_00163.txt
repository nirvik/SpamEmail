    Yeah, I need to work this out, too; I just learned my lesson about living on the bleeding edge. Lesson learned?  NO MORE XIMIAN, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.  Man, that was annoying.

    Anyway, I have returned to Redhat 7.3 on my root filesystem (saved my home directories, music and games on other partitions) and while I have the 8.0 stuff in the list, everything I want to upgrade requires 200+ RPMs.

    I'm not opposed to this, but apt is.  "apt-get dist-upgrade" dumps core.

    What's the inside secret here, or do I just start searching mirrors for the ISO and get over it?
