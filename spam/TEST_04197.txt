I have some time, so I would like to test 4.4. 
Thanks for pointing me to known bugs. I really don't have the patience to
search.

with klirc and lircd and modifying the kernel key map for my cinergy xxs
dvbt card ;-)

a big challenge was to setup the kde keys ... it's not very developed, but
the basic functionality works

In kde3 the "idiots" didn't think of us poor people not using latin and
associated per default ALT+K to switch the keymap. Now if you switch from
english to rushian/bulgarian or whatever ALT+K gives a completely different
keycode ... So I had to always change this.

Now in kde4 it's even better. You have to click ... and no reasonable
language switching combination is working. In this point Windows wins, as
it's per default configured to switch languages when typing (left)ALT+SHIFT

yes but not working for me and everybody running i915 vga card. this is also
related to X-Server and the a**holes from intel. (don't judge me the
notebook was given to me from the company I'm working for :-( )

the question is if it is compiling in kde4? and also if it is working well

The problem is that it was not iresponsive for just 10secs but forever.

I'll look to get a complete list. We'll have to discuss also the stuff we
don't need too.

this was my first impression. the conclusion is that it will stay unusable
for quite a long time yet.

your commitment is motivating me to do some testing ... may be it's time to
have some closer look at upcoming testing debian.

I'm still not that motivated as I would love to be, as I'm primary focused
on debian stable.

regards
