Since have done thanks, unfortunately Eircom 
have a severe case of 'selective hearing'. It 
seems that customer comments are only appreciated 
when they are positive. When I was complaining
they also decided that I wasn't a paying 
subscription customer but an Indigo GoFree one 
and that if I didn't use Windows that there was 
obviously something wrong with me (I mean who's
ever heard of Linux?).

True, I apologise for that. It was just the way
in which Eircom (didn't) deal with the ORBS problem.
