deja vu?
Hmmm.  Rumsfeld and Cheney are in
the white house, the president says
he's not a crook (and no, you can't
have those tapes), and the market is
melting down.

Anyone want to go to Andy Capps for
a beer?  I hear they have this new
game called "Pong"...

Have a nice day,
-Dave

Anyone seen Elvis lately?
