Now, I run sync manually, then unplug device, and after it umount are
ran by udev. Actually there's no certain point in doing so: I can run
umount instead of sync as well. The only reason why it's done like
this is the following: I just copied this configuration from
somebody's blog and didn't modify it (well, I *almost* didn't).

Yeah, that's exactly what I'm intended to do: switch to mutt. What
news reader do you mean? Is it some kind of plugin for mutt, or is it
separate application at all? Excuse me for offtop, you can answer
privately if you want.
