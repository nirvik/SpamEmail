The DoE has announced a high-speed data-transfer that runs on drillpipe, 
through "a 4-inch diameter steel pipe immersed in electrically conductive mud 
at pressures up to 1000 atmospheres, temperatures up to 150 deg C, and with 
vibrational accelerations of hundreds of g's:" 

    Now, with a high-speed, bi-directional communications link, a drilling 
    system's azimuth, inclination, pressure, temperature, loads and vibration, 
    along with information on rock characteristics near the drill bit, can be 
    evaluated almost instantly. Also, because of the ability to send high-speed 
    data through the drill pipe, technologies once thought unobtainable – such 
    as collecting seismic data at the drill bit – may now be possible. 

    With high-resolution seismic data collected "ahead of the bit," operators 
    could steer the drill bit more precisely toward oil- and gas-bearing sweet 
    spots and away from less productive areas. This will enhance the efficiency 
    of oil and gas wells and reduce the number of wells needed to produce a 
    reservoir.
