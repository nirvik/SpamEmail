Hi Sune, hi Debian KDE developers,

do you have any plans for Basket?

There is a Qt 4 port available Basket 2.0 Beta 1 (1.80).

It didn't show any basket contents after installation to my home=20
directory, but that might have been a problem with the installer script in=
=20
the upstream archive.

I think Basket is my last KDE 3 application.

Ciao,
=2D-=20
