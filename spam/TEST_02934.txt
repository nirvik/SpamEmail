cycle through windows causes freezeI just upgraded to Xquartz 2.5.0 and I'm having an issue with the
'cycle through windows' keyboard shortcut. Every time I hit command-`
it causes the X11 windows to freeze and become unresponsive. I'm not
able to move the windows, click the close buttons or have any keyboard
access to them.

This issue does NOT happen if I use the "Window -> Cycle through
windows" menu item - only with the keyboard shortcut.

There's nothing in the console logs. It happens whether or not I have
an external monitor plugged in.

Mac Book Pro
OS X 10.6.3
XQuartz 2.5.0 (xorg-server 1.7.6)

Thanks,
James
