Real viruses are filtered before they reach any mailbox for delivery.

Tose two addresses could be accessible only for internal mail.

And as a user is using this mechanism to build his own database of
spam/non-spam, that's his problem is he sumbit something wrong.

BTW, same forgery or wrong submission problems would exist if each
user had his own set of 2 addresses.
