I tried adding the bit about GetMovieTimeBase and 
SetTimeBaseMasterTimeBase to my project, and it didn't seem to help 
synchronization.

I also tried making a movie with references to the two video tracks, so 
that the video tracks would be playing in the same movie, and they still 
don't stay synchronized when playing.

It looks like I may have to require that the two movies be somehow 
preprocessed to be side by side in a single video track.
