[Spambayes] Deployment
    >> Ultimately I'd like to see tight integration into the "most popular
    >> email clients"..

The advantage of using a kitchen sink (umm, make that highly programmable)
editor+email package like Emacs+VM is that you can twiddle your key bindings
and write a little ELisp (or Pymacs) glue to toss messages in the right
direction (spam or ham).  For this, spambayes would have to operate in an
incremental fashion when fed a single ham or spam message.

(No, I have no idea what an "auto-ham" is.  A pig run over by a car,
perhaps?)
