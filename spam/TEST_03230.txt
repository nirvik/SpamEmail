Ahh, wonderful!  Just tried out these and *finally* got sound working
with my Abit TH7II-RAID's integrated audio.  I've been pulling hair
together with the (helpful) OpenSound people for quite some time now,
but we've failed to get sound to work, either with the drivers included
in kernel, or the commercial OSS.

Thanks a *lot* !  The RPMs seem to be fine, they worked for me out of
the box (on vanilla Valhalla w/latest errata).
