My .xsession-errors is now:

hugo@debian:~$ ls -l .xsession-errors
-rw-r--r-- 1 hugo hugo 200043 2010-05-19 12:34 .xsession-errors

and it is filled with:

...
error 173 request 152 minor 8 serial 1023
error 173 request 152 minor 8 serial 1176
error 173 request 152 minor 8 serial 1271
error 173 request 152 minor 8 serial 1323
...

I asked about that several times who knows where and when and nobody 
answered, as will be the case here.

It gets that way after I do (in Fvwm)

Key F9          A       M       Exec /usr/local/bin/xcompmgr -c -f

so that I can make my onscreen monitors grow translucent to see what is 
behind them:

Mouse 4         W       S       Exec /usr/bin/transset-df --min 0.1 
--id=$[w.id] --dec 0.2
Mouse 5         W       S       Exec /usr/bin/transset-df -p --inc 0.1 
--id=$[w.id]

But .xsession-errors gets initialized at the beginning of each session, 
who knows why...
