Re: Hanson's Sept 11 message in the National ReviewProbably because we have this pesky 1st Amendment thing here. Still, 
lots of us in the States have developed a disturbing tendency to shout 
down or (in recent years) shackle in legal BS opinions, thoughts, and 
individual behaviors we don't agree with.

You can just ignore it if you wish. But I must feel obligated to defend 
to the death your right to do so.
