Have you looked at the db4.x-util packages, for whatever version of
library you have?  The db4.6-util package contains a program called
db4.6-upgrade which might do what you want.  There are other version
of db-util, so get whichever one matches your current library and try
it on a *copy* to see if it does what you want.
