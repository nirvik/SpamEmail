Oops!  I take that back.  That kernel is still in Sid.

There are a couple of other things you can try.  One is to
intentionally disable ACPI.  That may cause other problems, but
you might want to try it at least for diagnostic purposes.  To
do that, specify

   append="acpi=off"

in your /etc/lilo.conf file.  Put it following the image line
for your default kernel.  That way, if it causes major problems,
you can boot your old kernel and ACPI will be on.  After editing
the file, run lilo, then shutdown and reboot.  You will need to
be root to do this.

Another thing you can try is to use the vesa driver instead
of the intel driver.  The vesa driver is slow, but a slow driver
is better than a driver that doesn't work.  Edit your /etc/X11/xorg.conf
file and change intel to vesa on the driver line.  Then shutdown
and reboot.  If the vesa driver works then its a likely that the
problem is in the intel driver.
