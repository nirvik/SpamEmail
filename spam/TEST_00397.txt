You're not dense. I'm going to zero the habeas scores on my copy of
SpamAssassin. I think they were added to SA quite prematurely. To me it's
simple:

1. People who send me legitimate email have absolutely no motivation to use
Habeas, at least until it gets lots more press, and even then only
bulk-mailing companies like Amazon or eBay are going to bother, and I
already whitelist them. Individuals won't bother.

2. Spammers have lots of motivation to forge the Habeas headers, and a good
percentage of them are completely out of the legal reach of Habeas.

I think it should be subjected to the same testing and scrutiny as any other
potential new rule. When I test against my corpus here's what I get:

OVERALL     SPAM  NONSPAM     S/O   SCORE  NAME
  13851     8919     4932    0.64    0.00  (all messages)
      0        0        0    0.00   -1.00  HABEAS_SWE

The score of -1.0 is pretty harmless right now, but it still looks like a
useless rule so far.
