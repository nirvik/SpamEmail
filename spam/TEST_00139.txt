I've in-place upgraded one of my production servers from Woody through Lenny
with only relatively minor issues.  I've been thoroughly impressed by
Debian's dist upgrade reliability since I starting using the distro in 2000.

Always read the release notes and other related docs before performing your
dist upgrade.  Failing to do so may cause unnecessary problems.
