I downloaded and played with it a bit, but had no time to do anything
systematic.  It correctly recognized a spam that slipped through SA.
But it also identified as spam everything in my inbox that had any
MIME structure or HTML parts, and several messages in my saved 'zope
geeks' list that happened to be using MIME and/or HTML.

So I guess I'll have to retrain it (yes, you told me so :-).

I'll try this when I have time.
