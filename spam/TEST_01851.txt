As others have mentioned, LCDs are always used best at their native=20
resolution. What exactly do you need the 4:3 aspect ratio for?

For example, if you have video content in lower resolutions and 4:3=20
aspect ratio you'd better let the player do software upscaling, it will=20
look better anyway. For other problems there might be other solutions.
