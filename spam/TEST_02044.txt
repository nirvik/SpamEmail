Like I said, I *have* looked at filesystem comparisons a number of times.

It's my problem to check your assertions?  Why isn't it your problem to
check my assertions?

Outside of one mention of "bugs on reiserfs that will not be fixed",
you're pretty much just describing the theory.  I do understand that
using relatively unsupported software, even if it's pretty mature
software, can have it's problems.

Just doing a few quick websearches, I'm reading about ReiserFS bugs
fixed as recently as 2006, 2007... It's not like it's not getting any
attention from developers.

I think you're better off if you rely on really well-tested migration
tools (e.g. "tar").
