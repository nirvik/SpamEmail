Please help a newbie compile mplayer :-)    
 Hello,
   
         I just installed redhat 7.2 and I think I have everything 
working properly.  Anyway I want to install mplayer because I heard it 
can play quicktime movs.  I apt-get source mplayer and dl'd it to 
/usr/src. 

         I tried to just rpm --rebuild mplayer-20020106-fr1.src.rpm, 
then I get ; mplayer-20020106-fr1.src.rpm: No such file or directory.

         Any help or a link to some document would be appreciated, Thanks
