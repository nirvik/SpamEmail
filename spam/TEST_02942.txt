Debian Etch n half hd-mediaHi,

I am looking for the hd-media installer files for Etch n half release. Are they still available somewhere?

For etch they are there for ex: [1]

I couldn't find them for etch n half.

(I have seen the warning on top of [2] but I need to install etch n half)

Thanks,

Loris
