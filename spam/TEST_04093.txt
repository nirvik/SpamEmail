By that standard, grub-pc should be removed from the distribution.
It may have upstream support, but based on other posts I've seen, it
effectively has no maintainer.  Which is worse, a package with
effectively no upstream support or a package with effectively no
maintainer?  And grub-pc is buggier than lilo.

I understand the need to remove packages with no upstream support.
But asking users to test a package with umpteen known release-critical
bugs, most of which have apparently been fixed upstream, but have
not been fixed in Debian because there is no maintainer to download
a new upstream version, is not a reasonable request in my humble
opinion.  Get a maintainer for it, fix the known bugs, and *then*
ask the users to test it.
