The Cocoa Bluetooth API was designed to be asynchronous after years of =
experience and problems with using synchronous APIs for networking.  =
Trying to translate it back into a synchronous multi-threaded API might =
be counter productive.

If you really need a synchronous API, the previous Bluetooth APIs might =
still be available.
