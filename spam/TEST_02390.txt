That's what I'd like to vary - particularly as the ftoc background isn't
constant - messages in the unseen sequence have a different background
than others.

In the ftoc that's fine, but in the sequences window, it isn't needed.
unseen already has a different foreground there (no problem with that),
it doesn't need a different background as well.

I'll play about a bit with this, and with making it vertical instead of
horizontal, and see what turns up.

OK.

In this case, highlighting wasn't what I was most concerned about.
A method to get messages in & out of sequences comes first, how it
displays is a secondary consideration.   But as a suggestion, have an
"all unknown" sequence highlight, any message in a sequence which has
no defined highlighting (where defined includes defined to not be treated
specially) gets highlighted the same way (maybe something as boring as
a dark brown text colour - almost indistinguishable from the normal black)

Done some of that.   First, the most significant change came from changing
relief from raised to sunken.   I don't know why, but it just looks better
(for me anyway).   But even with that, cur and unseen are still just a
bit too similar.   I ended up using

*sequence_cur:  -background {PaleGoldenrod} -relief sunken -borderwidth 2

The unnecessary braces are just because some of the colours I was using
had spaces in their names.   PaleGoldenrod translates as #eee8aa which
is probably safer for generic use.
