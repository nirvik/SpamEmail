I can't imagine why they're inching forward through 
13- and then 14- digit extensions; seems they should
just leap ahead to something with real headroom, say
40-digit numbers (128 bits or more). 

How hard can it be to widen the glyph area and 
narrow the bars? The sensors have got to be tens
or even hundreds of times more accurate/robust 
than when barcodes first took off.

One segment of the article along these lines:

A newly *patented* bar code, that merely fits 14 digits
into less space? I sure hope there's more to this
"invention" than "more lines, and narrower". 

They might as well go 2-D to fit in lots of extra bits,
which could also ease the transition to the capacity 
radio-transponder tags may offer.

A bunch of info on different barcode standards, including
2-D variants, with examples is at:

Something very much like a 2-D barcode is Xerox "Dataglyphs":
