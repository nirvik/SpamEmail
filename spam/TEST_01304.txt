Given the current size of HDs, dedicating a full one to /boot is a
waste since 250MB will be amply sufficient.

You should use either one HD to replicate your current system on a
larger disk or two and set up mdadm to use RAID 1 array.

At work, someone (probably a project manager who convinced the
powers-that-be that we were "misallocating san resources") convinced
management that we shouldn't slice up our Solaris boxes with the usual
/, swap, /var, /usr, /opt, and /export/home. This decision carried
over to our RHEL servers and I have followed suit in my private and
moonlighting habits and I split up my disks into / and /home (and
/boot if using mdadm and/or lvm). We have 1,000s of servers and get
the occasional "root is over 90%" alert but it has been a mostly
painless change.

If you really want separate partitions for /usr and /var, check your
current usage with "du -sh /usr; du -sh /var" and use those values
plus a decent margin to set up a new layout.
