Hello,

You could try this as root :

# cd /etc/exim4

# touch local_host_blacklist

# touch local_host_whitelist

# touch local_sender_blacklist

# touch local_sender_whitelist

# chown root:Debian-exim local_*

# chmod 640 local_*

I've created these files on my Debian Lenny box and they work very well. 
For the 'local_host_blacklist' file I add entries such as :

*.spammer.host
xxx.xxx.xxx.x/24
xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx

For the 'local_sender_blacklist' I add entries such as :

*@spammer.example
*@spamoverload.invalid
!crisisofconscience@spamoverload.invalid

In the above example the last entry would be an exception and would not 
be blocked. Alternatively I could add that entry to 
'local_sender_whitelist' for the same effect.


Also check out this web page for some really in-depth examples of spam 
filtering with Exim :

http://www.sput.nl/software/exim.html


When trying out new filters you can use 'warn' instead of 'deny' which 
will just add a header to the email message rather than reject it at 
SMTP time. The header inserted is the contents of the 'message' line :

warn
   message = XHeader1: This mail failed on spam test 1.

.. rest of acl ...


Hope this helps.

Regards,

Pete.
