There are still IBM Mainframes around that use EBCDIC (yes, that is  
not just an IT legend). I don't know if they can run a UNIX-like OS  
and if you can compile your C code to run on it, but even if you  
could, I'm not sure someone in possession of such mainframe will lend  
it for you to run your tests. :-)

IBM Mainframes apart, I don't think any machine that you should  
actually care for is non-ASCII.
