I don't scan my disk partitions with it, but all incoming as well as
outgoing email is scanned with ClamAV (by amavisd-new). ClamAV with some
3rd party signatures (SaneSecurity) works quite well in that. Not
because it detects good, but clamav_daemon is the only daemonized FREE
anti-virus for Linux.

And my Linux is a server for my Windows workstation. Without Windows, I
would not bother scanning viruses.
