  | exmh has a funky cut/paste model that is essentially all my fault.
  | The middle click sets the insert point.  If you hate that, go to the
  | Bindings... Simple Edit preferences window and de-select
  | "Paste Sets Insert".  

Unfortunately, the side effect of that solution is that it is no longer
possible to cut/paste within one sedit window, some intermediate client
always must be used (except in the rare case where you want to select
some text, and then paste it at the same place).

That's because the click that you have to (with this option) make to set
the insert point, also kills the selection (it ends up reverting to the
last selection made in some other window, or something like that).

So, the vast majority of people probably want that "Paste Sets Insert"
enabled - that one you can learn to live with, the other is much more
painful.
