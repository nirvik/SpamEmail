I think you'll find it's at Eircons end. I occasionally have problems
sending to a server I use, whose admin said it's a known bug for which
he had to apply a patch... you'll probably want to tell eircon's admins
that they need to patch the server, and to re-do it if they think it's
already done...

sorry for the lame answer, but it's been so long I've forgotten the
details.

Have Fun,
Jim.
