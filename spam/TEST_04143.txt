I haven't yet tried installing the Tiger X11 on a Snow Leopard machine - =
would the instructions for doing this under Leopard still work?

Are you experiencing problems when you set the X11 color depth to 256 =
colors in the preferences?

I think the instructions may still be valid.  I'm not 100% positive, =
though.  You can also try the package I made a while back:

=
http://static.macosforge.org/xquartz/downloads/Leopard/X11_Legacy-1.1.4.1.=
pkg
http://static.macosforge.org/xquartz/downloads/Leopard/X11_Legacy.README

I think there may be a problem with the quartz-wm in that package, but =
it should work ok if you use Snow Leopard's quartz-wm instead.

This is really not a supported approach, but hopefully it'll help.  If =
you have any problems, let me know, and I'll try to help.
