inbox mail notification broken
Hi,

I am experiencing a strange problem since a couple of days now,
I have several folders with unseen sequences, and when there is
new mail they are highlighted. This works fine.

But .. since a couple of days the actual inbox won't be highlighted
any more when there is new mail. On the other hand the unseen window
still indicates if there is new mail in the inbox.

All other folders seem to work properly.

Any hints ?
