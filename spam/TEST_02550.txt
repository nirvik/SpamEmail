Pb with mplayer-0.90pre7Hi,
this is my first problem with one of the freshrpms rpms ...
I just upgrade mplayer and now I get

$ mplayer 
mplayer: error while loading shared libraries: libdvdnav.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

I guess Matthias has forgotten libdvdnav dependency.

They told me I needed WIN95 or better
So I chose Linux!
