I would like to install RPM itself. I have tried to get the information by
visiting www.rpm.org <http://www.rpm.org>  and the related links they give
but they all seems to assume that RPM already is installed.
I have a firewall based on linux-2.2.20 (Smoothwall) for private use.
I would like to install the RPM package/program but there is no information
how to do this from scratch.
Found this site and hopefully some have the knowledge.
Best regards Manfred Grobosch
