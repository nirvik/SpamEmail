Re: It's a small worldShort version:
T-Mobile Broadband is in the process of wiring every starbucks in the area
(T1 backhauled to some ~local POP + 802.11) as part of what I'm told is a
national rollout. The Diesel is close enough to the Elm St starbucks for me
to get reasonable net throughout most of the cafe. 

The rumor is that they'll be announcing that they've got boston covered on
the 21st.  I've heard from at least one source that they're actually going
to announce a much wider national rollout at that time.  It's not cheap [1], but
for soemone like me who's running a ~virtual corporation, it's well worth it.
