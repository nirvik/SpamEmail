[IIU] Eircom aDSL Nat'ingHi all,

apologies for the possible silly question (i don't think it is, but), 
but is Eircom's aDSL service NAT'ed?

and what implications would that have for VoIP? I know there are 
difficulties with VoIP or connecting to clients connected to a NAT'ed 
network from the internet wild (i.e. machines with static, real IPs)

any help pointers would be helpful,

cheers
