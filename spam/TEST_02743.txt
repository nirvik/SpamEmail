It won't.  That's not the way Sid works.

On Sid packages can come and go.  Since 'safe-upgrade' won't uninstall 
packages, once you enter a "dead end" on Sid, it won't go away by itself: you 
will need to uninstall those packages and after that install the new 
versions, probably with new dependencies, old dependencies trashed away, etc.

On Sid you are expected to go the "full-upgrade" path and do it both wisely 
and often.

"Wisely" because, not as in Stable, you can't just "blindly" upgrade 
everything, but you will want to cherrypick this or that based on its 
current "breakability" status (i.e.: you follow debian-devel list and learn 
that currently, say, libc, or KDE is almost broken and heavily updated, so 
you may decide to stay away from them.  After some weeks, those become 
more "palatable" but then it's the time for Openoffice to go "fun", etc.).

"Often" because if you let the system to "rot" for few months or even few 
weeks, you end up with a nightmare of packages to work with instead of only  
a few you can manage easier (that's the case for the system you outline in 
your post).

So, with Sid, you should test for a "full-upgrade" almost daily.  Then you may 
decide to upgrade by hand only a subset you feel more comfortable with and 
then, even for such a subset you may need to uninstall (or let the system 
unistall) some packages and after the fact you'll need to reinstall them 
manually to let the system recompute new needs, dependencies, etc.

Cheers.
