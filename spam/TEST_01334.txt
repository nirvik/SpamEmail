Re: inbox mail notification broken
Hi,

sorry, but I am not very familiar with this sequence business and
couldn't find an answer to my problem in the documentation.

In fact, to be precise, it seems only to be the highlighting in
the folder cache part and only for the inbox which does not work.

Is there anything I could/should check ? Any file, .. ?

Thanks,
Marc
