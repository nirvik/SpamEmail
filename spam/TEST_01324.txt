Yes, compiling KDE is not a hassle that I want to take.

Exactly, I need a stable distro.

That is not really an option, as I want the _latest_ KDE, not simply
4.4. I contribute to KDE and it is important for me to be on the
latest version. I cannot be on a distro that is perpetually a few
point releases behind.

Thanks, Liam! I am still weighing my options, including Debian-based
distros that may be more up to date. I am currently on Kubuntu, but
the 10.04 release is simply terrible and I'm looking for a new distro.
Suse would be my next choice, but I prefer Debian-based.
