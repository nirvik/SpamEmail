 mysql -u root -pmy\$ql -N -B -e 'show databases'

works

I was to get the script

#!/bin/sh
for DB in `mysql -u root -pmy\$qlPW -N -B -e 'show databases'`; \
   do echo $DB; \
   mysqldump -u root -pmy\$qlPW -e $DB > /var/mysql-1hBak/$DB.sql; \
done

to work.

yes I would eventually do that but even then you need to escape the $ inside ``
