And will run Solaris 9 when Sun catch up with the x86 drivers and kernel.

Although don't hold your breath for the free DVD. It will never come.

(Spot the person who applied for the free Solaris 9 DVD, only to be told
three months later it is no longer available.<mutter>)

FWIW Solaris and Linux seem to be getting closer all the time. I can no
longer see any specific reason why one is better than the other. Expect Red
Hat Solaris 11 any time now... <grin>
