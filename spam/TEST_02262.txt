  The command-line output of aptitude is somewhat underdocumented.
Please feel free to submit bugs regarding bits of output that you think
need documentation.  I know there are lots of bug reports, but trust me,
I do read them, and it's better to have those notes than to have an
email lingering on some mailing list.

  I just tweaked this to uniquify and sort the strings, so you should
just get "now, stable" and "testing, unstable" in future versions of
aptitude (the multiple copies probably mean you have more than one
source for each version, which isn't interesting to know in this
output).
