Curious is that there are some packages for linux, also for 64-bits 
systems:

http://www.hulu.com/labs/hulu-desktop-linux

But, what's that (Hulu Desktop), a special program to watch movies and tv 
series inside a dedicated application instead using the browser? :-?

Yes, that is an option.

Users having problems with flash plugin on their 64 bits OS can install a 
32 bits browser and run the 32 bits plugin, which is annoying but it 
should work.
