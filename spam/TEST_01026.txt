APT has such built-in feature, see
  /etc/cron.daily/apt
Which you can configure manually, or...

On Debian-Gnome installation, you can install update-notifier-common
which provide the file /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/10periodic, which contains
the required apt settings:
  APT::Periodic::Update-Package-Lists "1";
  APT::Periodic::Download-Upgradeable-Packages "0";
  APT::Periodic::AutocleanInterval "0";

(Since I don't use it on my laptop, I can't give you much details)

On servers, you might want to une apt-listchanges to get notifications,
see:
