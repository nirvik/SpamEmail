KDE's LCD weather station appletHi everyone,

Can anyone tell me what package provides the KDE applet called "LCD 
Weather Station"?
I found a bug in it and don't know against what should I report it 
against. 'aptitude search'
and grep don't seem to help (or I'm having a blank moment). Thanks.
