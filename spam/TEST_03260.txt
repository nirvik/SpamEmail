This may be a better way than I have been forced to do it.  Circular 
depencies crop up in Sid a lot.  The solution then is usually to be 
patient and wait for the Debians to straighten it out.

However, sometimes, one can't wait, and at such times, I have downloaded 
each package directly, using a web browser (or wget) and then used dpkg 
with options like --ignore-depends= or --force-overwrite.  Not 
recommended.  Not for newbies.  Not for the faint-of-heart.

But if we wanted to play it safe, we would stick to stable, and only 
upgrade to major releases.  And we would be content.  (And never learn 
anything.)

dpkg --auto-deconfigure is a gentler way, but you might want to see if 
aptitude can make some suggestions before jumping off the deep end.

And don't neglect the -s option of apt-get (and corresponding option of 
other package managers) to do dry runs.
