RE: [SAtalk] user_prefs ignoredThis is just an semi-educated guess - if I'm wrong, someone please correct
me!

Spamd setuid's to the user running spamc. Since you're calling spamc from a
global procmailrc file, it's being run as root (most likely). If called as
root, spamd won't open user_prefs files.

>>From the spamc man page:

       -u username
           This argument has been semi-obsoleted.  To have spamd use
           per-user-config files, run spamc as the user whose config
           files spamd should load.  If you're running spamc as some
           other user though (eg. root, mail, nobody, cyrus, etc.)
           then you can still use this flag.


The solution is to set DROPPRIVS=yes in /etc/procmailrc, just before running
spamc. From the procmailrc man page:

       DROPPRIVS   If set to `yes' procmail will drop all privileges
                   it might have had (suid or sgid).  This  is  only
                   useful  if  you  want  to guarantee that the bottom
                   half of the /etc/procmailrc file is executed on
                   behalf of the recipient.


I hope that helps, and I also hope it's right!

|
|
| Hi All,
|
| I am running SpamAssassin 2.41 with procmail as my local delivery agent
| with sendmail.  I use spamc/spamd so that it runs site-wide from
| /etc/procmailrc.
|
| spamd is run as root with the flags "-d -a -c", and spamc isn't run with
| any flags.
|
| When I was testing the program, I deployed spamc from my personal
| ~/.procmailrc file, my ~/.spamassassin/user_prefs file was read each time.
| I can see this because I have a non-default "required_hits" value which
| gets reported in every e-mail on the "X-Spam-Status" line.
|
| Now that I run spamc from the global /etc/procmailrc file, my
| ~/.spamassassin/user_prefs file is no longer being read or processed from
| e-mails from outside computers.  The "required_hits" value gets set back
| to the one in /etc/mail/spamassassin/local.cf.  However, if I send local
| e-mail, my user_prefs file is read and processed correctly.
|
| Does anyone know how to fix this problem?  if this is a spamassassin or
| procmail bug?
|
| Thanks,
|
| Cheryl
