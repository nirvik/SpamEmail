the dated address that my from appears as is a good address for five days
for anyone.  after that it requires a confirm message from the sender.
my regular email address requires a confirm address if i haven't
explicitly given permission to the sender.

and yes, spammers could try to set up a system to reply to my confirm
messages, but that would require them to a) give out a valid email address
in their From headers, and b) use a lot more bandwidth then they do now
(thereby costing them more money).

oh, and they can't forge confirm messages.  the confirm message system
works something like this:

    message goes in the pending q and is assigned an id.
    that id is encrypted and used to create the from address of the
	outgoing confirm mail - kevin+confirm+kghdsfg@ie.suberic.net
    only a message to that address will work to free the message from
	the q (or i can free it using tmda-pending).

all of this is discussed on http://tmda.sf.net/
