I didn't mind the ads. The problem is that the ad
server Opera puts on your machine is a PIG. Every
time it goes to change the ad, it thrashes my
laptop for thirty seconds. So no, I don't mind
the ad, but I do mind that serving ads cripples
the browser.

Alas, Mozilla is also a PIG. So I'm back to using
IE, which seems to be the only free, reasonably
featured browser that runs decently on my laptop.
I'm open to alternatives ..
