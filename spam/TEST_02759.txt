Again. AFAIK KMail doesn't use Akonadi at all. Its the new KAddressBook=20
that based on Akonadi. And since KMail uses it for address completion...

=46or the user it looks as if KMail uses Akonadi, but to the best of my=20
knowledge it doesn't - at least not directly. Otherwise there wouldn't be=20
much point in the akonadi- / nepomuk-based rewrite of KMail as KMail 2.

And I want to add: It does not render it unusable for everyone.

Even when Akonadi does not start up cleanly, which happens on first start=20
of Kontact for example as I reported already, I still *can* use KMail. Its=
=20
just that the address book function do not work properly then. Although I=20
didn't even verify this. Cause even when I get the Akonadi startup errors,=
=20
KAddressBook shows the list of the people in my address book, its just=20
ghosted out and not clickable. So maybe address completion would still=20
work. But even if it doesn't, KMail as a whole actually does still work=20
then.

Anyway, most important is to file and an all bugs with Akonadi in KDEPIM=20
upstream ASAP. And that is where I suggest that people - including you=20
Boyd - put their energy now.
