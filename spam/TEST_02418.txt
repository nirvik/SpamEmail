I think locale is the same for terminal and non-terminal apps, except 
you can set locale separately for each separate environment.


echo $LC
echo $LC_MESSAGES
echo $LC_CTYPE
echo $LC_COLLATE
echo $LC_TIME
echo $LC_MONETARY
echo $LC_NUMERIC
echo $LC_PAPER
echo $LC_NAME
echo $LC_ADDRESS
echo $LC_TELEPHONE
echo $LC_MEASUREMENT
echo $LC_ALL

(unset LC_ALL if you need different locales for different things)

echo $LOCALE
echo $LANG
echo $GDM_LANG




In C:


#include <locale.h>
#include <stdio.h>
//
// not tested
//

char *some_locale="C";
if setlocale(LC_MESSAGES,some_locale)
    printf ("messages locale set to %s\n", some_locale);
else
    prinf ("setlocale failed\n");
// .
// .
// .


Off the top of my head...
