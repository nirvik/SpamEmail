Well, shiver me timbers, but my favorite pirate phrase is missing from 
both of those.Arrr....
and wondering if there's a rap equivalent.

*Q AND A SECTION*

*SHIVER MY TIMBERS*

/From Tad Spencer/: "Please could you tell me where the phrase /shiver 
my timbers/ originated?"

This is one of those supposedly nautical expressions that seem to be 
better known through a couple of appearances in fiction than by any 
actual sailors' usage.

It's an exclamation that may allude to a ship striking some rock or 
other obstacle so hard that her timbers shiver, or shake, so implying a 
calamity has occurred. It is first recorded as being used by Captain 
Frederick Marryat in /Jacob Faithful/ in 1835: "I won't thrash you Tom. 
Shiver my timbers if I do".

It has gained a firm place in the language because almost fifty years 
later Robert Louis Stevenson found it to be just the kind of old-salt 
saying that fitted the character of Long John Silver in /Treasure 
Island/: "Cross me, and you'll go where many a good man's gone before 
you ... some to the yard-arm, shiver my timbers, and some by the board, 
and all to feed the fishes". Since then, it's mainly been the preserve 
of second-rate seafaring yarns.
