Re: Any luck with HD web cams?Interesting!
Though I agree with Mark that the Logitech is a pretty darn good camera.

For tracking people though, do you really need HD resolution?
The Logitech for example slows way down at above 640 x 480 resolution,
to something below 10 hz as I recall.

You might be better off using a couple of PS 2 Eye cameras, which
can run at 120 hz at 320 x 240, and treating people as low-resolution,
but low-latency "blobs".
