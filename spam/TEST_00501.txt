  |   | 7.3 seems to support Chinese input out of the box, it's got
  |   | miniChinput and some other stuff no documentation.  [ ... ]
  |   | Can anyone tell me what I should do?
  | 
  |  I've no idea, but a relevant/useful source of info could
  |  be the «linux-utf8» e-list:
  | 
  |      http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/unicode.html
  |      http://mail.nl.linux.org/linux-utf8/
  |[ ... ]
  |  w.r.t. X11 applications [ one approach is to use ]
  |  what's called an XIM (X Input Method).   [ ... ]

 sorry for replying to my own post!

 a google for "xim linux" found a number of hits.
 try (I've haven't finished reading this myself,
 but it seems good):

   http://www.suse.de/~mfabian/suse-cjk/

 (CJK stands for Chinese Japanese Korean.)

 the above is probably best read with a browser
 that groks UTF-8.

cheers!
