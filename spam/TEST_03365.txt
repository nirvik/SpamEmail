XQuartz upgrade broke my DISPLAYFor some reason, after upgrading via the automagic upgrade thingy, =
DISPLAY is set to "org.macosforge.xquartz:0.0" and I can't run X =
programs.
The xterm that starts by default works fine, and I can start more xterms =
with shortcut keys, but that's it.
I didn't set this anywhere. Anyone have an idea where this is coming =
from?
