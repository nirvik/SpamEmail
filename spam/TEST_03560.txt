You need a Mac with a trackpad that supports the native Cocoa scale, =
rotate, and swipe events - or a MagicMouse, which only supports swipe.

The gesture support is not a replacement for tablet input methods. =
Particularly, it does not express the "touches" information about =
individual finger positions: a swipe on a glass-trackpad MacBook Pro =
uses 3 fingers, whereas the swipe on a MagicMouse uses 2. =46rom Cocoa's =
perspective, they are both the same swipe gesture though.
