Oh, I'm afraid I have no relation with "recordmydesktop", I just told you 
beacuse is one the most recommended aplications for video screen capture, 
I think due to is a command line based tool and also can be used with a 
GTK or Qt frontend which suits very well for both KDE and GNOME users O:-)

Istanbul seems to be more oriented for a GNOME environment, which in your 
case should be a plus :-)
