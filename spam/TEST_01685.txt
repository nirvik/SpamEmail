[Spambayes] [ANN] Trained classifier available    http://sf.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=61702

    This is the binary pickle of my classifier after training on
    my first spam/ham corpora pair.  All records with
    spamprob == UNKNOWN_SPAMPROB have been purged.

It's in a zip file, and is only half a meg.

Jeremy, it would be interesting if you tried that on your data.  The false
negative rates across my other 4 test sets when run against this are:

      0.364%
      0.400%
      0.400%
      0.909%
