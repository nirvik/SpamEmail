I think my mail wasn't very clear ;-) My point was that we should continue 
releasing new rules and removing broken ones (all based on discussions on 
this list of course) in the 2.4 branch instead of creating a new 2.5 branch 
everytime we have a bunch of new rules.

A new branch should be openend only if (big) new features are introduced 
(eg. Bayes) or the interface has changed (spam_level_char=x). As the rules 
are under fluent development, the user has to update quite regularly. But 
currently he couldn't be shure if the new release will break anything in 
his setup (like -F going away). So if we say "the branches are stable to 
the outside and just improved under the surface but you have to watch out 
when you update to a new minor version number", users and sysadmins could 
be less reluctant to update.

All just IMHO :o)

P.S.: I'll be away from my box and my mail account for one week, starting 
tomorrow. So happy coding for the next week :-)
