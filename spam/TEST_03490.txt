[SAdev] Alternatives to the GABTW Ken Shan suggested making a set of corpus data publically available,
so that different classification algos can be tried out.

I'd be happy to do that -- providing the nonspam.log and spam.log files
from my mass-check output (ie. the "matrix of test results" in Ken's
terms).  Along with the default scores, this is the entire input data set
for the SpamAssassin GA system.

So, if anyone wants a go, contact me by mail.
