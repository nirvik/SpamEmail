Not many apps actually use gtk2 yet. If they do, it's obvious because it is a
different tool kit. With gnomehide, I ported a lot of gtk1.2 themes to gtk2,
because they are rarely compatible. Those themes are on dudex.net/rpms/ but it
does not matter unless you have gnome2.

In gnomehide, the apps that actually use gtk2 are Nautilus, gedit, some of the
"utility" apps, like dictionary, calcultor, the settings applets, and of
course the gnome panels and menus.
