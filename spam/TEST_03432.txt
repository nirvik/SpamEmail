For anyone to fully bury global warming, they would need to explain why the
dramatic increase in CO2 concentrations are not increasing the global
temperature. They would also need to explain why, worldwide, glaciers are
melting faster than they have previously in the historical record. That is,
people need more than refutations, they need a compelling alternate
explanation (hint: climate variability doesn't cover all the bases).
