Yes, that is perfectly legitimate.  It is a math / accounting thing.
You get a paycheck for $100.  You get a bill for $20.  You add them
up.  Some of the additions are negitive debit amounts.  My bank
statement always has a long list of + items and - items.  If I can
keep the + items more than the - items I am doing good.
