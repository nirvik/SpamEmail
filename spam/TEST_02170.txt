Hi Miles.  Many of us have done this for years and years.  You can go with 
a serial console over rj45 (including bios level tools) like iLO or DRAC 
or you can get Linux to provide you with a 'software serial console' that 
will be available from the bootloader (lilo or grub) onwards.

A quick Google should turn up howtos on how to configure Grub & friends.

I've always used true serial ports to do this although I understand it is 
possible via usb-serial connectors.

You can use any serial terminal app to provide access to the serial port. 
I prefer minicom but there are lots of options.

Keep security in mind when doing this.  If soneone gets root access[1] to 
one of the servers then they can 0wn the other one.  Don't cross-connect 
the serial consoles unless the servers are in the same 'security domain'.

[1] You can restrict who can talk to minicom for example.

Cheers,

Rob
