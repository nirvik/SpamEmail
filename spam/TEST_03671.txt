Having skimmed over the patent, it appears to be describing a sort of
image compression algorithm which gels more or less with the JPEG
mechanism. Since I don't quite understand how jpeg works (it's hard
math, and I'm just a dumb comp. eng.) I don't know how exactly it
matches up to JPEG. I'm more curious as to whether it covers MPEG,
because it /is/ described in the context of video streams rather than
stills, and I had a vague impression that the MPEG and JPEG
compression techniques were similar. One of the patents it references
also seems to hint at MPEG.

Let's all use PNG, eh? *cough* *wheeze*

Cheers,
Waider.
