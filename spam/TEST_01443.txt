>>From Ed Felten's "Freedom to Tinker" site, regarding the TinkleToonz Musical 
Potty.: 

    This handy toilet training aid offers a "magical, musical land of potty 
    training," by playing a tune whenever liquid is deposited in it. Since it 
    plays digital audio, it qualifies for regulation as a "digital media 
    device" under the Hollings CBDTPA. If the CBDTPA passes, any newly 
    manufactured TinkleToonz Musical Potties will have to incorporate 
    government-approved copy protection technology.
