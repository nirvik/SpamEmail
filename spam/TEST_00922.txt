Anybody buying a box like this is undoubtledly going to integrate it into their
crypto infrastructure.  What's the point of putting in a box like this if it's
not an active participant in your security framework?

Blah, blah, blah.  The marketing FUD gets compounded by the Beberg FUD, talk
about 20x bloat.

What gives you the impression that's what they're doing?  That's not what the
text says.  It's largely fluff anyway.

Uhhh, fundamentally it's all machine code.  Kelly's comment seems more like
drivel from a clueless marketroid than anything of technical concern.

Having what appears to be a silicon XML router would be a cool thing.  Having
one integrated with your crypto environment would kick ass.  Let it
deserialize/decrypt/repackage the XML before handing it off to the app servers.
The question, of course, is does it work with actual applications in the field
without tremendously reworking them.  Somehow I doubt it...
