Documentation about RPM macros?Hi,

   Can someone tell me where I can find some
   documentation about rpm macros?  In
   particular, I'd like to understand the
   '%files devel', '%post -p', and '%postun -p'
   uses described at 

    http://freshrpms.net/docs/fight.html

   and, more generally, I'm looking for a
   more detailed description of the available
   macros and the options they accept.  There's
   no description of the above uses of %file,
   %post, or %postun in the maximum-rpm book.

   Thanks in advance for any help!
