Derby permissionsHi!

Since I am a Java Developer, IT staff have asked me why after repairing =
permissions with Disk Utility, Derby always appear with an incorrect =
permissions group.

As far as I know, the permissions are fine, but the package receipt was =
not properly updated, or wrongly set.

I have to admit it is an annoying message:

Permissions differ on "usr/share/derby", should be drwxr-xr-x , they are =
lrwxr-xr-x=20
Repaired "usr/share/derby"

Why does it take so long to fix that issue or why it cannot be fixed? I =
thought it would be repaired in the next Java update.

I would like to give a convincing answer, not this: =
