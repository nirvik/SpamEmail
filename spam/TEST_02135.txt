The new ish of Strange Horizons in out, with an interview with Bloodhag, the 
most metal of the all the science fiction metal bands. 

    Soon, the spotlight comes up again. The lead singer grabs the microphone. 
    "This is Frank Bellknap Long!" he yells, and, feverish, launches into a 
    lecture on Long's oeuvre. There can't be more than a handful of people on 
    this earth who could get a beer-sodden thrash crowd to listen to an English 
    Lit lecture. Thirty seconds later, the audience is sufficiently educated, 
    and the guys begin to wail. Jake the singer holds the microphone over his 
    head and belts out the song in a growling voice that's monster-movie low. 
    "No reason! No corners!" he shouts. Two minutes later, they're done with 
    the pulps and ready to move on to the New Wave. "Our next song is about 
    Harlan Ellison!" Jake bellows, and the geeks, the hipsters, the metalheads, 
    and the drunks let out a howl of mutual joy. 

    Blöödhag -- note the dual umlauts -- hails from Seattle. Describing 
    themselves as "edu-core," the band performs nothing but two-minute thrash 
    tributes to science fiction writers. Between songs, the band pelts the 
    audience with paperback books, quizzes them on book titles, and demands 
    that the audience show their library cards. Their motto: "The Faster You Go 
    Deaf, the More Time You Have to Read."
