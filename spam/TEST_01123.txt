GetMediaSample2 performance problemHi,

I'm using GetMediaSample2 to retrieve sample of a video (H264)
to feed them to ICMDecompressionSessionDecodeFrame.

Usually, after the first frame has been read, GetMediaSample2 is
quite fast with timing as low as 1ms, which seems to indicate
some kind of caching.

However, and randomly, GetMediaSample2 will sometimes takes timings
like 1000 ms to read a single frame. This happens with a pattern
I cannot really understand, for example :

(the integer numbers are frame numbers, "last frame" is the last frame
I have been processed, and "cur frame" is the requested frame when
there is a "hole" between the last frame I processed and the one
I'm asked for)

frame read: 1159.920201ms at 34	
last frame: 34	
cur frame: 40	
frame read: 1048.547101ms at 37	
frame read: 1061.771239ms at 38	
last frame: 63	
cur frame: 102	

or

frame read: 922.650834ms at 26	
frame read: 981.708654ms at 34	
last frame: 49	
cur frame: 60	
frame read: 240.574639ms at 166	
(here my scheduler can keep up with the
long frame read because I put a big read ahead
time for my tests)

Do someone knows where it might come from ?
Or should I write a sample cache code (I already have some), use
CopyMediaMutableSampleTable and the like and expect better timings ?

Thanks in advance for any informations on that matter,

Raphael
