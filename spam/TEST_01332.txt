The T-Mobile Sidekick -- the first commercial implementation of the wonderful 
Danger Hiptop PDA/phone -- is now onsale and the reviews are starting to 
appear. As soon as I'm in San Francisco for more than a couple days straight, I 
really think I'm going to pick this up. 

    That's partly because it costs less than half as much as its current 
    competitors -- $199, compared with $450 and up for the others. In the same 
    spirit, T-Mobile will offer unlimited data usage on its new, relatively 
    high- speed "GPRS" network for $40 per month -- far below what a serious 
    surfer would likely rack up under competing wireless-data plans. (Voice 
    time is another story -- more on that later.) 

    Another reason I like the Sidekick's prospects: It was designed for, and 
    will be pitched to, a very different market. While vendors of the competing 
    hybrids focus on "enterprise" customers -- the big businesses that are 
    supposed to have deep pockets for this sort of thing (even though most 
    clearly don't at this point) -- Danger and T-Mobile are targeting, in their 
    own words, "Internet-savvy, primarily urban, young adults in the 18- to 
    34-year-old demographic." 

I am that demographic! Link[1] Discuss[2] (_Thanks, Steve[3]!_)
