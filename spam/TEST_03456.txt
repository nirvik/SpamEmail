I had that last January:
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=567700
but with 2.6.32-trunk-686 and nvidia proprietary drivers.

Upgrade of X and drivers to NVIDIA-Linux-x86-195.36.15 and 
xserver-xorg-core 2:1.7.6-1 on March 28 "fixed" it.

Now I run either linux-image-2.6.32-3-686 and 195.36.24 or 2.6.33.3 and 
the former and system is solid.

I can't run a 2-seater without proprietary driver.
