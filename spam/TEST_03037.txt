Konsole 4's Profile handling is utterly broken. There are multiple
bugs open upstream about this, none of which has been commented on by
the developers. I don't see any interest of upstream in fixing these
issues.

I still hope that 4.4.3 will fix the krunner instabilities that were
introduced in 4.4.

These two issues make me wish to have kde3 back every single day. Eye
candy is important, which kde4 has more than kde3, but breaking my
bread-and-butter application that badly is a real turn-off.
