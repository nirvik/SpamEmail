[Razor-users] can't find Razor/Client.pmApologies if this has been answered before on this list.  I can't
find a way to search the archives.  I did my best to scan through
the archive messages, but can't find my answer.  Please advise if
there is a search engine somewhere, Thanks. 

I'm trying to set up a smtp relay mail server using postfix,
Spamassassin, and amavisd-new.  (no local delivery, just an
anti-spam filter box)  I have installed razor-agents-sdk-2.02 and
razor-agents-2.125 (in that order) on a RH 7.3 box for this.  But
when I try to load amavisd from the command line (as root), I get
errors with:  

Can't locate Razor/Client.pm in @INC.  But the machine does have
a Client.pm on it, in fact, several, at:

/usr/lib/perl5/5.6.1/Client.pm
/usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.6.1/WAIT/Client.pm
/usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.6.1/Client.pm
/usr/lib/perl5/vendor_perl/5.6.1/Frontier/Client.pm.rawcall
/usr/lib/perl5/vendor_perl/5.6.1/Frontier/Client.pm

What am I missing?  Thanks!

Scott
