If you don't know why this is happening, then you shouldn't be doing this!

This is because you don't have the md driver _in_ the kernel

You'll need a small i.e. 20-30MB partition out of raid to boot from with
i.e. initrd which loads the md driver and your raid device becomes visible.

It doesn't matter if it's a pendrive or something else.
