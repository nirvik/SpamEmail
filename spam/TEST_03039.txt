Why not... it's just that sometimes it gets a bit more confusing in the
spec file since you have to change the "Source:" as well as "%setup" to
reflect the name changes. But it might also sometimes be even easier the
way you suggest, if the entire package contains only references to the
final version and that only the archive name has a "pr1" or "beta6" in it
for example.

Take for instance xmame : I've been packaging 0.61 pre-releases as
"0.61-fr0.x" since the entire source has only "0.61" tags everywhere, no
preversion tags whatsoever.

Still, I don't think "Epoch:" is an evil hack although it's true that it
may cause problems between distributions when used. Wanting to avoid it
when possible is a good thing indeed ;-)
