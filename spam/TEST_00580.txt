  With aptitude 0.6.2+, I'd be curious to know whether you get the
answers you want (with less removals and less need to manually hold)
with this setting or something like it:

Aptitude::ProblemResolver::SolutionCost="2*removals + canceled-actions,safety,priority"

  (sorry about the long line)

  That will ask aptitude to minimize the number of removals and canceled
actions, but to weigh removals as being twice as bad as holding packages
back.

  Forbid-version is probably more appropriate, yes.
