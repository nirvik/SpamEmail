Hi, Yup I added a second one; just in case the first one not working
was an anomaly and it still doesn't show up in what Xfce calls a tray.

I used the 'recordMyDesktop' back end from my term and it ran
successfully and converted the video when finished. The picture was
screwed up; but that's a different problem. So it appears to be a
problem only with the gtk front end, and possibly only with Xfce ...
Not sure yet.
