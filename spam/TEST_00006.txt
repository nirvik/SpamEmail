 This is actually a raq3. Though, I do have an old raq2 that Liam was
helping me get netbsd on (about all you'll get on a 16MB machine these
days).

 Anyway, I wussed out, and copied hda1:/ to hda2:/boot and set the bootfs
to be hda2. It worked, though it's mounting an ext3fs as ext2. But I'm
getting there.
