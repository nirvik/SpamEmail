I just want to be sure, that forwarding an email to my own spamtrap address
which performs a razor-report on the entire received email is not waste of
time, because the contents of the forwarded email is not recognized as equal
to the email originally received. The forwarded email has a new set of
headerlines, which should be discarded and instead the headerlines of the
original message are in the body of this new message and should be recognized
as such and treated properly.

An ordinary Forward Unquoted in Agent is subject to character set conversions
and does not depict the received spam in its original form.

I hope this clarifies my concerns.
