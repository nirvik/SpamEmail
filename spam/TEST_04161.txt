They removed /their/ Java VM. They didn't remove the ability to run Java
programs.
Anybody is free to develop their own Java VM and make it kick ass. As
someone said earlier in the thread, nobody is capable or willing to do that.

I've done a bunch of Java and haven't run into huge problems running the
same bytecode across Solaris or Win2K.
What actual problems have people actually run into. Actually.
