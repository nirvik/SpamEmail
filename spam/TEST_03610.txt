/etc/bash_completion ?Howdy,

Following this link ( 
http://www.debian-administration.org/article/An_introduction_to_bash_completion_part_1 
) and if I type at the terminal '. /etc/bash_completion' everything 
works top-notch. However, if I put the above command in the global 
.profile or in my user's profile, after typing my user/pass in gdm, I 
get errors. If I put '. /etc/bash_completion' in ~/.profile, I get the 
'your session lasted less than 10 seconds' and the reason is 'cannot 
open /etc/bash_completion' . If I put the command in /etc/profile, I get 
some errors about mismatched parantheses. Am I doing something wrong? 
It's annoying to type '. /etc/bash_profile' everytime. Thanks in advance.

Yours,
