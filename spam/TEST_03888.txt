I also experienced this problem, and found that liberal use of noscript and 
flashblock really helped. I finally got fed up and just started using chrome. 
Chrome isn't perfect, but it is certainly a lot faster than firefox/iceweasel.

Merciadri -- does the same thing happen when load a lot of tabs in other 
browsers? Try it with other gecko based browsers, and then with webkit based 
browsers.
