[Razor-users] false-positive foundRazor v1 just called a post to the mutt-users mailing list SPAM
with the following signature.

        b230a8ed84eb262bed1f2c908703990d3483b55f

BTW, is there are another way for us folks still using v1 to
revoke false-positives such as this without posting to the list?

Thanks.
