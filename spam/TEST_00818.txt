Well, there seems to be no consistency in the thoughts behind the
maintainers decisions.   Perhaps Debian should provide some guidance?
  Another example, look at mod-security, it's got current stable
(etch) pkgs in backports, and unstable packages in main.   Maybe I'm
not following the logic behind these decisions, if someone can point
me to an FAQ I would appreciate it much.
