[Razor-users] log problemI just set up razor and spamassassin, but I keep getting this error in my 
mail log file

razor2 check skipped: No such file or directory Can't call method "log" on 
unblessed reference at 
/usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.0/Razor2/Client/Agent.pm line 212.

I have looked through the archived list and the only thing I have seen 
about this error is a possible permission problem on the log file.
I did what it said in the archives, basically change the permission on the 
file but its still no go.

Any other help would be appreciated, maybe I'm missing something.
something I forgot to run or do.
