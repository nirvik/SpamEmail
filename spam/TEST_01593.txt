Ouch...

I'm note sure how to bypass this.

I "hate" Acrobat Reader for many reasons (as much as I even do not have 
it installed on my linux systems because is a hog program and tends to 
hang the system) but I recognize that sometimes is needed to fill signed 
PDF forms and also has nice printing features -well, when the application 
is able to detect all the printers, of course ;-). 

Anyway, a simple option you can try is by manually adding a custom 
printer in Acrobat Reader and check if that works...
