Multiple Graphics cards and HDMI: How to?Hi all,

I have setup a system with Gigabyte MA-790GPT-UD3H motherboard and use a
Nvidia GeForce 8600GTS PCI-E video card. It also has an onboard ATI
Radeon HD 3300 graphics chipset. The PCI-E card is being used at the
moment for the monitor (nvidia driver). I was thinking of using the HDMI
port(onboard) to play movies directly on the TV rather than using a
DVD-RW (current method).

I did configure the onboard chipset to be detected after the PCI-E card
as D-SUB+HDMI output in the BIOS. This is on a Debian Unstable box.

The question is: would it be possible to use two graphics cards from
different manufacturers?

I also noticed that the onboard chipset does not come up with lspci.

Any suggestions on how to proceed with this?
