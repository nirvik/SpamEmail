Re: Safely delete (35-pass) file with a Java applicationThank you for your suggestion of using RandomAccessFile and not to use
35-pass rewrite.

As I wrote, I might just use srm terminal application to safely delete
files (which is included in MacOS X).
And as well, I might do the 3-pass rewrite (in case of normal hard
drives) and 1-pass rewrite in case of SSD drives.

Is there possibly any chance of figuring out, whether the user has SSD
or normal HDD? I mean, out of java?

Thank you for your answers.
