Did you have any security upgrades lately or did you install packages
from backports or volatile, or any non-Debian stuff? I am surprised that
a stable system should exhibit such a sudden regression.

Another thing to try is to activate the desktop icons for removable
devices and test if users can mount the devices by clicking on the
icons.

AFAIK, that is exactly how it should be for Lenny, so all members of the
plugdev group should be able to send dbus messages to hal. Absence of
such permissions is a very common reason for point-click mounting to go
wrong, but that does not seem to be the case for you.

I suspect that the fstab entry is not really a problem. Maybe you can
setup pmount for the individual users so that it is more convenient.

Unfortunately I do not understand what else your dbus error message is
trying to tell us. I would run "lshal --monitor", then plug in a USB
stick and try to mount it; maybe that will turn up something useful.

Seeing what hal knows about a USB stick might also help; hal can be
queried like this:

lshal -u $(hal-find-by-property --key block.device --string "/dev/sdX")
lshal -u $(hal-find-by-property --key block.device --string "/dev/sdX1")

(Replace "sdX" as is appropriate)
