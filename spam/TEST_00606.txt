AA Meetings the Hottest Place to Meet Women With Big Bucks

If you're looking to hook up with female millionaires you could try some of
the classier restaurants or clubs, but the best place of all is a certain
New York City Alcoholics Anonymous meeting.

According to a Details magazine story cited in the New York Post, "the No.
1 location to score a megabucks babe is an Alcoholics Anonymous center on
[New York's] Upper East Side.

"It's the choicest meeting in town, right next to the Ralph Lauren store"
on Madison Avenue, which features "rich vulnerable women," the mag's
October issue says.

AA officials were not overjoyed by having the address of their meeting
place published, or being cited as the "in" place for finding loaded women
- or rather, women who are loaded.

"The purpose of our meetings is to let people share their experiences and
help others find sobriety. It is not a place to pick up women!" an AA
spokesman told The Post.

O.K.
