There are many different type of VPNs... Is the server already running? 
Do you know what it is using (openvpn or PPTP for example)?

If it is your job to setup both the client  and server, openvpn could be 
a good place to start. Their documentation is quite good. If you need to 
connect to an existing VPN server, you need to know the type of VPN 
before you can choose client software.
