[ILUG] Samba login questionI have a situation with a small network as follows:

A number of client workstations which are running VMware, each of which will
run a local copy of Samba (not the VMware autoinstalled version) to let
VMware access local linux disks.

An NIS/NFS server which will also run Samba to allow the VMware clients
access to its filesystems.

How can I set things up so that all the VMware clients (all running 'doze
98, possibly being upgraded in future to W2K) authenticate against the NIS
server's Samba ? I have read the Samab documentation in  large quantities
down through the years but as I've never wanted to do anything like this, I
never paid much attention to all the stuff about domain controllers etc.
which I presume is what I will need to have running here.

I would also like, if at all possible, to have synchronisation of passwords
between the NIS domain and the NIS server's Samba with minimal manual
intervention.

Ideas, accompanied by annotated Samba configration files :-) , gratefully
received.
