Ah, that has more sense.

Let's see what's inside the script.

(...)

There is a download URL variable poiting to:

http://dl.google.com/earth/client/current/GoogleEarthLinux.bin

Which works.

But the script also allows the user to point to a local file (using 
modifier "--file") as a fallback option, I guess. Nice :-)
