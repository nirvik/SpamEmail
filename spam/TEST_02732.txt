Re: My brain hurtsOkay, here's a joke I *just* made up while I was driving my car at home:

One day a pirate walks into a bar with a steering wheel
   attached to his crotch. So the bartender says to him,
   "You know you have a steering wheel attached to your crotch?"

    And the pirate says, "Aaar, its driving me nuts!"
