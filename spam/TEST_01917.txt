That's generally a grave bug -- see the Liskov substitution principle =
for details.

If you must, there's a very dirty trick to do the former, a =
comparatively clean way (but not intended for this) to do the latter:

@interface Subclass:YourClass
-(double)count; // would report a warning with proper declarations. If =
you want a hard error, declare eg. NSSize. VERY dirty. Don't.
@end

@implementation Subclass
-(int)count { // would throw when called. Somewhat dirty. Don't unless =
really needed.
  [self doesNotRecognizeSelector:_cmd];
  return 0; // just to get rid of the warning
}
@end

I am not sure what the question means. You haven't to, but generally =
rather should, depending on the design and your needs -- far as I =
understand (which is very dubious).

Best,
