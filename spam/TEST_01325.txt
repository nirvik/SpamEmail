That does not seem to be entirely true as was mentioned elsewhere in this=20
thread:

http://trinity.pearsoncomputing.net/

However this seems far away from the man-power behind KDE 3 until 3.5.10.=20
To truly get forward with this one it appears to me that way more=20
developers are needed. Who then would have less or no time to work on=20
improving KDE 4.

I will stick with KDE 4 - as long as it - as a whole - does get better=20
from release to release. It already got better. It already takes longer=20
than with KDE 3 to get as stable and nice to work with as KDE 3.5.10, but=20
with help of everyone it eventually will get there. And KDE 3.5.10 had=20
issues as well. Especially with KMail that Boyd is so interested in. KMail=
=20
as of KDE 4.3 *and* 4.4 appears to be way more stable to me regarding that=
=20
annoying index handling issues. And it has been improved a lot by Thomas=20
McGuire and others. Okular is fine, Dolphin is fine, KWrite, Kate are fine,=
=20
Dragon player is quite fine, Amarok is quite fine lots of other apps are=20
fine. I think mainly Akonadi, Nepomuk, Plasma, a bit also Phonon needs=20
quite some more stabilization and performance work.
