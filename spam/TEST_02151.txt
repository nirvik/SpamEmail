[Razor-users] Windows port / bug reports?Hi,

Newbie (to the list) question;  I've been working on porting the code to
run under Perl on Windows.  The changes are fairly minor and can be made
to interoperate with the current code.  How would one best go about
getting those changes merged in (better question, would there be
interest in such a version and getting those changes merged in)?

Bill
