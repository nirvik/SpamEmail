Java for Mac OS X Developer Preview (10M3064+9M3164)Java Developers,

Please download and install our new developer preview of Java for Mac OS =
X (10M3064+9M3164) at =
<https://connect.apple.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/MemberSite.woa/wa/getSoftwar=
e?bundleID=3D20609>. This preview is an update for both Mac OS X 10.6 =
and 10.5, so be sure to download the correct disk images for your =
system.

Also, please check out the release notes, even if you can't install the =
preview. We've made many interesting enhancements, and fixed a few key =
regressions we think you will want to know about before "Java for Mac OS =
X 10.6 Update 2" and "Java for Mac OS X 10.5 Update 7" goes live to all =
Mac OS X users.

Please tell us about any issues you find at =
<http://bugreporter.apple.com> with an attached reproducible test case, =
if possible.

As a reminder, please do not discuss the contents of this preview on =
this or any other public forum.

Thanks much for your help!
Mike Swingler
Java Runtime Engineer
