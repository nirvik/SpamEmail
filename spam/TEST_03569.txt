  | so I'll probably poke around at the sequences performance issues,

Well, there's this wonderful piece of code in MhSeqExpand ...

    # Hack to weed out sequence numbers for messages that don't exist
    foreach m $rseq {
        if ![file exists $mhProfile(path)/$folder/$m] {
            Exmh_Debug $mhProfile(path)/$folder/$m not found
            set ix [lsearch $seq $m]
            set seq [lreplace $seq $ix $ix]
        } else {
            # Real hack
            break
        }
    }

which is going to run slow if a sequence happens to start with a bunch
of messages that don't exist.   I'm not sure why it is important that the
first message in the sequence returned exists, but not necessarily any
of the others, but I'm sure glad it is, as MhSeqExpand gets called lots,
and I don't know if I could cope if it were checking every file in the
sequences it is looking at, all the time...

It may help to keep a list of the valid message numbers for the current
folder (though that would then need to be verified against changes to the
directory).   Does tcl have a directory read function?   I assume so...

Mh_Sequence also goes and rereads the files (.mh_sequences and the
context file) but I'm not sure how frequently that one is called.

Have a good vacation.
