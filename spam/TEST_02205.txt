Try passing the SMART test (by using the manufacturer's test disk or 
"smartctl", but as they are attached to a USB port, smartmontools may 
have problems to detect and scan the device).

It won't tell you a concrete number of "bad blocks", but higher values in 
"Reallocated Sectors Count" could give you an idea about the remapping 
operations performed by the disk (the lower the better).
