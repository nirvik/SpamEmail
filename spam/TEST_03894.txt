Re: Linking message [was: Re: Patch to complete a change...]
2) In the main window, the "+" key puts you into a "change 
   folder" mode (the first time you use it after starting exmh),
   hit a second + and you go to "set a target" mode.  Type a few
   characters of the folder name and hit space for autocomplete.

I should have finished this off.

3) Keep hitting space to loop thru all the folders that match 
   the characters you typed.  Hit return to actually select the
   folder shown in the message area.

I don't use this for navigating into nested folders as the only 
thing I have nested is my archives.  Someone else will have to 
tell you how to do that if there are any tricks to it.
