[ILUG] Network problemsHi guys,
	I'm looking for help on this one. I have a server with SME5.5 installed
- used to be e-smith. It's based on RH7.1, has a 3c507 NIC, and is
connected to a hub. Also connected to the hub are a laptop and
workstation, both with RH7.3 . The server supplies DHCP amongst other
things.
	The problem is interruptions in the network. If I ping the laptop from
the workstation, or the other way around, there are no problems, i.e.
shows up as 0% loss. If however I ping the server from the laptop or
workstation, it will do a few packets, anywhere from 3 to 20, and then
stop responding, it will start again after a little while.
	The server is definitely not overloaded, 128Mb, and seems to be
configured correctly. In /etc/modules.conf,;

options 3c507 irq=0x5 io=0x300
alias eth0 3c507

there is an option in there for something called hisax, but whatever
that is, the machine doesn't have one.
	doing route shows 192.168.0.0 as going through eth0 which is correct.

	Any help on this appreciated.

	Eamonn
