Usually security fixes are uploaded "priority=3Dhigh", which means faster=

migration (3 days?). Sid is still ahead, but not by 10 days.

During this cycle the security support is not there (yet). Might happen=20
during the freeze. But also the maintainer might take the *stable* patch=20
and adapt it for the package in sid ;)

Makes sense. And if you care about security do subscribe to=20
debian-security-announce and debian-testing-security-announce. You don't=20
need the later if you run pure stable, but makes sense in any other mix=20
(including backports). The traffic of both lists combined is about one=20
message per day.

I install stable as much as I can due to:
- security support
- low maintenance overhead

Once installed just watch debian-security-announce (and debian-announce=20
for point releases if you don't use proposed-updates) and=20
update/safe-upgrade as needed.

I installed testing for people who thought Debian is just too old=20
(usually with KDE 4, which makes a good impression to Windows users). =20
Unless the user already has some Debian experience it's a must have that=20
I can somehow regularly access the system (usually ssh).

I would get terribly bored if I was to run anything else but sid on my=20
own laptop. The only other machine at home is now pure stable, but mpd=20
won't play my favorite stream (aac unfortunately).
