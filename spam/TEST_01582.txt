[ILUG] Cobalt question Try this little problem on for size:

 I've installed Redhat 7.3 on a raq3's disk. But fscked if I can get the
kernel in /boot/vmlinuz-2.4.18-3 to boot. It's insisting pulling the
kernel from ... somewhere else. The old cobalt kernel.

 I've booted the disk with a redhat rescue CD, and installed grub on the
MBR and hda1 & hda2 (just in case). No luck. The cobalt BIOS says "Booting
default method - From disk".

 Any ideas how I can get this thing to boot *my* kernel ? Anyone care to
guess how the cobalt boot process ? Google seems very quiet on the
subject of the cobalt boot process, and what is there doesn't seem to
work. Simple stuff like:

 (how to boot a different kernel)
 http://list.cobalt.com/pipermail/cobalt-developers/1999-December/022014.html

 And, on boot:

Cobalt:Main Menu> bfd /boot/vmlinuz-2.4.18-3
First stage kernel: Decompressing - done
Second stage kernel: Decompressing - done
Linux version 2.2.16C28 (konkers@unicron.cobalt.com)

 Note the descrepancy between what I want to boot, and actually booted.
