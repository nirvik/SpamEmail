Re: AA Meetings the Hottest Place to Meet Women With Big BucksGary Lawrence Murphy:
>OK, but only if you also meant religious and alcoholic extremes ;)

Since it was my quip, I'll point out that I used
the term "alcoholism," implying addiction. I
drink. I'm not an alcoholic. Most people who drink
don't go to AA meetings. Most people who go to AA
meetings do (try very hard) not to drink.

As to religion, I think it is harmful and risky in
almost any degree. Were I single, I might consider
potential mates who partook of the less irrational
or more light-hearted religions. A Unitarian or
Buddhist might be an example of the first, a Wiccan
of the second. But someone who is both irrational
and serious about that irrationality strikes me as
a bad choice of partner, moreso than someone who
was addicted to some drug. Alcoholics and drug
addicts at least have the sense to battle their
problem, and to keep their children from suffering
it. The religious revel in their irrationality,
and want to raise their children in it. That's a
difficult difference for two parents to
reconcile.

Fortunately, I am long and happily enamored of
someone who has no religious tendencies.
