  Based on your description the whole thing would be 1 part.

  If your mail contains a fwd of a mail *inline* with mime boundaries, 
  then your mail is all consindered to be just text.  If you fwd
  the mail as attachment, the attachment is considered to be a separate
  part  - but the attachment is not broken down further for
  various reasons as mentioned before on this list.

  You should also see 'method 5' in your debug logs.
