hello Camaleon,

That was it: I used the GNOME shutdown dialog: I thought it would call
hibernate?

When I use hibernate, I get this log:

=> so it seems to work. Still I got an error message and hangup
concerning uvcvideo on resume a few days ago, but unfortunately I don't
have the error message around.

Thank you for your help! Maybe the problem is fixed by using
/usr/sbin/hibernate.
