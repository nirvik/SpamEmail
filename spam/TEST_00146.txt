[Razor-users] Viewing my trust rating?Hey Folks

I know this question gets asked a lot, but I haven't seen an answer lately.

Any idea when a user will be able to view his own trust rating?   What are
the plans for this?  Will it be built into the client, web based, emailed
to you nightly?  If you could share your brainstorming on the subject, I
would greatly appreciate it.
