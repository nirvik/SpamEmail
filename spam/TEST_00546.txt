ibook g3 no soundhello there,

i am newbie to debian and have installed it on my ibook g3 (900mhz). i
have tried my best to go through forums and try to solve 
the problem but have had no luck. i was wondering if you would be able
to guide me with this problem. i would just like the headphone jack to
work. 

Thank you so much for your time and keep up the good work

Rohit
