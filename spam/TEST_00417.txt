InfoSpace CEO to step down

BELLEVUE, Wash. AP) - InfoSpace Inc. chairman and chief executive Naveen 
Jain will step down from his posts once the Internet services and software 
company finds a replacement.

Jain, a former Microsoft executive, founded InfoSpace six years ago and led 
the company through its rise and fall. His departure from the top posts was 
announced Wednesday.

With its stock now trading for dimes, InfoSpace is in danger of being 
delisted from the Nasdaq Stock Market. The company is asking shareholders 
to approve a one-for-10 reverse stock split to prop up the price. If 
approved on Sept. 12, shareholders would trade in 10 shares of stock for 
one new share.

The company has had trouble retaining its top-level executives in the past, 
including most recently, former chief executive Arun Sarin who resigned 
last year after just nine months on the job.

The company said Jain will remain as a company employee.

Shares of InfoSpace fell 2 cents to 43 cents in afternoon trading on Nasdaq.
