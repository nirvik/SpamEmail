he'll be speaking at a couple of special [1]London.pm meetings, at the
approprately named [2]Conway Hall in [3]Central London.

The first is [4]Life, the Universe and Everything on Tuesday 27th August,
and the second is [5]Perl 6 Prospective on Thursday 29th August. Both
start at 6.30 pm sharp, so we can fit in the maximum possible
Damian-ness.

We hope to see you there!"

Budapest. We'll meet on 26th August at 17:00 at a location we'll announce
within a few days on [1]our mailing list. Planned agenda: How to raise
camels on the Hungarian Puszta.

You can read more details (in Hungarian) [2]here. Non Hungarians who
happen to be in the area are also welcome, though the presentation(s)
will be given in Hungarian."
