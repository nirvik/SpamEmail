Hm. One could do this with rpm's --justdb switch too, without having to 
make a dummy package, right?

I was wondering that this is a bit dangerous if there is a update for my 
software, as the dummy package might get updated with it overwriting the 
installation I've done from source... Not good.

Is there really no "--nodeps" kind of switch in apt-get?
