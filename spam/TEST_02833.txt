You have not explained why the increase in CO2 concentrations is not
contributing to increasing global temperature.

Precisely which theoreticians do you mean? What, exactly, do you mean by a
global warming theoretician -- scientists in this area don't use that term.

I assure you that not all scientists performing modeling of global
temperature phenomena agree with your assertions.
