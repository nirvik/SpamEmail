Which Apaptec model, specifically?  Some of the Adaptec SATA cards are
fakeraid.  I want to know if your card is fakeraid or real RAID.  That may
have bearing on this issue.

I've never run into these issues because I intentionally avoid them.  I
always create a small /boot of about 100MB at the start of the disk and
stick the bootloader in the MBR.  Every BIOS can handle bootstrapping such a
setup.

I thought the OP originally said he has a separate small /boot, so I'm still
not sure what his exact issue is.  Thus what I'm trying to nail down exactly
which Adaptec HBA he's got.
