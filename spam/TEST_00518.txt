You can't.

But as per you above comment, it seems you are already using Sun's Java 
JRE.

Run "update-alternatives --display java"

Type "about:config" in the address bar and change:

plugin.expose_full_path

to "true"

Then close Icewesel and open it again, and type in address bar:

"about:plugins"

And look for the plugin in charge of handling Java files (checkout the 
path to the file).

Note 1. Can you send the link to the file you are trying to launch?
