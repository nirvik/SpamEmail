[IIU] IIU: Recommendations on phone / pda+phone + European GPRS coveragehi all,

thanks for the good information on the choice of phones, pda choices.

as an aside i also saw that 3com have released a usb blootooth dongle. 
that in a lptp combined with a 6310i with the blootooth (with HSCSD) 
might be a nice thing to have (if they work!)
i'm doin up a little doc, so if anyone is interested i'll post my findings.

cheers!

mit bestem,

Bernardino
