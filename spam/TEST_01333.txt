I don't know about this /particular/ mood, but I have used
neuro-conditioning with aiding children in stressful
life-circumstances.

Basically, you somehow evoke the state you want, and when you get it,
you do something odd, anything at all will do, but I used a gentle
"vulcan grip" on their shoulder.  Later, when faced with the
uncomfortable situation, you can retrieve /part/ of that earlier more
desireable state by giving them the pinch; it's not perfect (like you
get with simpler brains) but it is an inescapable effect.

This is probably the neuro-effect that leads to performance-enhancing
superstitions such as Bob Dylan not performing without his favourite
jean jacket: Because it provides the cue to a more relaxed mental
state, he really does play better with it than without it.
